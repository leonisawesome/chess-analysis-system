How to Calculate Chess Tactics
Valeri Beim
Thinking methods are at the heart of the chess struggle, yet most players devote little conscious effort to improving their calculating ability. Much of the previous literature on the subject has presented idealized models that have limited relevance to the hurly-burly of practical chess, or else provide little more than
ad hoc
suggestions. Here, experienced trainer Valeri Beim strikes a balance by explaining how to use intuition and logic together to solve tactical problems in a methodical way. He also offers advice on when it is best to calculate ‘l

When does the endgame start?

That’s a simple question and there should be a simple answer.

But we don’t have one.

Among the definitions that have been suggested are:
a) When the kings can safely take part in play,
b) When neither player has more than the equivalent of a queen and a minor piece left, and
c) When the main goal of the players is promoting a pawn.

But one or more of these definitions fail to describe many positions we would definitely call endgames.

I can’t attack without my queen and other pieces.

Why should I want to trade them?

Attacking is one of the three basic ways of winning a chess game.

The other two are amassing a material edge and accumulating positional assets.

A good trade can improve your chances of success in all three ways.

156.

But trades are just trades.

How do they help me win?

There is often a subtle difference between the traded pieces.

If you swap a passive knight for a well-posted knight, this is a plus.

So is trading a “bad” bishop for a good one.

4.1: Weakness in the Castled Position
The castled position is weakened when any of the pawns that form the protective barrier in front of the king – namely the f-, g- and h-pawns – have advanced.

It is more weakening to advance a pawn two squares than one, and even more weakening when more than one pawn has been advanced.

Other types of structural weakness occur when one of the pawns is either lost or doubled.

A lack of support for the castled king by its own pieces (for instance, the absence of the usual knight from f6 or f3, or, especially, of a fianchettoed bishop from g7 or g2) can cons

How to Build Your Chess Opening Repertoire

Whether a novice or a master, every player needs to select an opening repertoire. In this book, the first to focus on these issues, Steve Giddins provides common-sense guidance on one of the perennial problems facing chess-players. He tackles questions such as: whether to play main lines, offbeat openings or ‘universal’ systems; how to avoid being ‘move-ordered’; how to use computers; and if and when to depart from or change your repertoire.

Attack with Black
Valery Aveskulov
Need a reliable way to fight for the initiative when White plays 1 d4? Grandmaster Aveskulov presents a sound but ultra-aggressive repertoire based on gambits that have proved their worth in grandmaster play over many years. The Benko Gambit offers Black very active piece-play and intense positional pressure. If White dodges the Benko, we hit him with the Blumenfeld, sacrificing a pawn to set up a strong pawn-centre. Aveskulov examines all of White’s options and move-orders after 1 d4 Nf6.

Secrets of Attacking Chess
Mihail Marin
What are the premises for a successful attack? Marin discusses the traditional concept that a player with the advantage is obliged to attack, and also the value of notions of logic and justice in deciding whether to attack. If we believe an attack is justified, but cannot back it up with concrete variations, how do we decide whether to trust our intuition? Marin surveys typical attacking scenarios, such an attack on two wings, with a queenside attack as a prelude for a swift strike on the other wing, and all-out attacks against apparently well-defended p

Introduction
The relative importance of the endgame
In my first years in the world of chess, I used to read a lot about the importance of a good knowledge of endgames and the futility of studying openings.

I used to find this kind of statement not only in
Capablanca’s works, but also in many articles from magazines of that time: sentences like ‘Grandmasters’ greater understanding is most clearly noticeable in the endgame’ and similar things.

Strategy used to receive the same, or similar, treatment when compared to tactics.

You could read sentences like ‘Grandmasters spend much more time in

Almost any amateur who is willing to put in a small amount of work, is able to achieve this (though unfortunately, for some people it takes too many years) and actually that is enough until the moment one reaches, say, a FIDE rating of around 1900-2000.

Beyond that point, greater endgame skill is a must.

At this stage, problems usually arise, but the upside is that this extension of a player’s endgame skill will usually be enough at least until he becomes an International Mast

That leads me to my next question.

How much book knowledge do I need?

Some authors claim you must master 100 or more “book” positions to play endgames well.

This is not true.

All you really need to know are some of the positions with relatively little material, such as with fewer than six pieces and pawns.

Don’t worry about the more complex endgames.

Until you are a better than average player, most of your endgames will be pretty one-sided.

Either you or your opponent will probably be a minor piece or several pawns ahead.

When does the endgame start?

That’s a simple question and there should be a simple answer.

But we don’t have one.

Among the definitions that have been suggested are:
a) When the kings can safely take part in play,
b) When neither player has more than the equivalent of a queen and a minor piece left, and
c) When the main goal of the players is promoting a pawn.

But one or more of these definitions fail to describe many positions we would definitely call endgames.

Improve Your Positional Chess
Carsten Hansen
Throughout a game of chess, we must constantly make judgements and decisions that cannot be determined simply by calculation. We must then rely on our positional judgement. Good positional skills are primarily developed by experience, but they can also be learnt. In this book, Carsten Hansen provides a wealth of advice and ideas that will help give readers a helping-hand up to new levels of positional understanding.

Sacrificing

Why does a sacrifice make sense?

It means you have less material to attack with.

But not at the area of the board you are attacking.

Compare it with war: A more skillful army may win when it concentrates its forces at an area where a larger army is spread thin.

By giving up some of his material, the sacrificer hopes to generate greater force at that point of attack.

A sacrifice turns “matter into energy,” as a great attacking player of the past, Rudolf Spielmann, put it.

4.7: The Exchange Sacrifice
The ‘exchange’ is the name we give to the difference in value between a rook and a minor piece.

Hence we frequently find in chess books and magazines the expressions “win the exchange”, “sacrificing the exchange”, “the exchange up”, etc.

An exchange sacrifice – giving up a rook for a bishop or a knight – can be an extraordinarily effective way to change the course of a game.

This is partly because players subconsciously regard a well-protected minor piece as immune to the threat of capture by a rook.

This is a vast subject, especially when long-term positional e

Winning “technique,” as it is called, is difficult to master because it requires skills very different from those used in the other phases of a game.
