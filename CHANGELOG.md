## ITEM-032: Phase 6.1a Debugging (November 10, 2025) ✅

**Problem:** All 3 diagram features broken after Phase 6.1a deployment
- GPT-5 writing `[DIAGRAM: ...]` placeholders (6 found)
- Featured diagrams returning 0 items
- 0/10 relevance sources appearing (10 found)

**Root Cause:** Flask module caching + data flow timing issues

**4 Fixes Implemented:**
1. **Code Loading Verification**: Added canary prints, cleared `__pycache__`
2. **Featured Diagrams**: Fixed data flow timing (diagrams attach at line 536, not 472)
3. **0/10 Filter**: Verified already correctly placed after GPT reranking
4. **GPT Placeholders**: Strengthened prompt + added regex strip fallback

**Test Results:**
- Italian Game query: 4 featured diagrams ✅
- epub_diagrams properly attached to results
- Defense in depth: prompt engineering + post-processing

**Files Modified:**
- app.py: Removed premature epub_diagrams copy, kept canary
- synthesis_pipeline.py: Strengthened prompt (line 188), added regex strip (line 338)

**Partner Consultation:** Gemini, Grok, ChatGPT identified caching as root cause

**Commit:** 72252f8

## ITEM-031: Book Ingestion (November 10, 2025) ✅

**Books Added:** 2
- Dvoretsky's Endgame Manual 6th Ed (1,053 chunks, 1,275 diagrams)
- Under the Surface 2nd Ed by Markos (346 chunks, 501 diagrams)

**Stats Change:** 920 → 922 books, 309,867 → 311,266 EPUB chunks, 534,467 → 536,243 diagrams

**Bugs Fixed:**

## ITEM-030: Duplicate Book Cleanup (Previous session) ✅

- Removed 4 duplicate books
- macOS `._*` metadata files properly ignored (not deleted)
- Tool created: `find_current_duplicates_fixed.py`

---

## ITEM-029: Static EPUB Diagram Integration (November 9, 2025) ✅

- Extracted 536,243 diagrams from 922 books
- Created `diagram_service.py` with in-memory index
- Flask `/diagrams/<diagram_id>` endpoint
- Frontend rendering with lazy loading
- Ranking: Text similarity + keywords + quality boost

---

## ITEM-028: RRF Multi-Collection Merge (Complete) ✅

**Phase 5.1:**
- Query router with intent classification (8/8 tests passed)
- RRF merger with k=60 and collection weights
- Parallel multi-collection search with asyncio
- `/query_merged` endpoint with complete pipeline
- UI integration with dual scores and collection badges

**Phase 5.2:** On hold (waiting for PGN corpus expansion to 1M games)

---

## ITEM-027: PGN Ingestion System ✅

- All 1,778 games validated
- 1,791 chunks in `chess_pgn_repertoire` collection
- 100% query success rate
- Variation splitting for oversized games

---

## ITEM-024.7: JavaScript Rendering Architecture ✅

- Restored clean separation between backend and frontend
- Path B implementation (chessboard.js)

---

## ITEM-011: Monolithic Refactoring (October 2025) ✅

### Problem
`app.py` was 1,474 lines - unmaintainable monolith with synthesis, chess parsing, and diagram generation all mixed together.

### Solution
Extracted into 9 specialized modules:
- `rag_engine.py` - Vector search (105 lines)
- `reranker.py` - GPT-5 reranking (88 lines)
- `synthesis_pipeline.py` - 3-stage synthesis (179 lines)
- `chess_positions.py` - FEN/PGN parsing (122 lines)
- `diagram_generator.py` - SVG generation (145 lines)
- `content_formatter.py` - Markdown formatting (89 lines)
- `validation.py` - Quality checks (67 lines)
- `query_router.py` - Intent classification (71 lines)
- `rrf_merger.py` - Multi-collection merge (92 lines)

**Result:** `app.py` reduced to 262 lines (Flask routes only)
**Reduction:** 82.2% code reduction in main file
**Architecture:** Clean modular design with single responsibilities

## ITEM-008: Sicilian Contamination Bug (October 2025) ✅

### Problem
Querying "King's Indian Defense" contaminated with Sicilian Defense results:
- 70% of results were Sicilian instead of King's Indian
- Root cause: Regeneration feedback loop in 3-stage synthesis
- Stage 2 would regenerate Stage 1's correct results with wrong opening

### Solution
**Removed regeneration entirely** - each stage runs once:
- Stage 1: Generate outline
- Stage 2: Expand sections (no regeneration)
- Stage 3: Add diagrams (no regeneration)

### Results
- **Before:** 30% success rate (7/23 queries succeeded)
- **After:** 100% success rate (23/23 queries succeeded)
- No contamination across 50+ validation queries
