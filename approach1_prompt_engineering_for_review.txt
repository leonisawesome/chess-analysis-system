How to Calculate Chess Tactics
Valeri Beim
Thinking methods are at the heart of the chess struggle, yet most players devote little conscious effort to improving their calculating ability. Much of the previous literature on the subject has presented idealized models that have limited relevance to the hurly-burly of practical chess, or else provide little more than
ad hoc
suggestions. Here, experienced trainer Valeri Beim strikes a balance by explaining how to use intuition and logic together to solve tactical problems in a methodical way. He also offers advice on when it is best to calculate ‘l

Two moves is more than most players can see.

Three moves is about the maximum for serious tournament players.

But masters must calculate much further?

Yes, when they believe they need to calculate.

But they make most of their moves without that much look-ahead.

Even elite players are not calculating machines.

A good trade can improve your chances of success in all three ways.

The castled position is weakened when any of the pawns that form the protective barrier in front of the king – namely the f-, g- and h-pawns – have advanced.

It is more weakening to advance a pawn two squares than one, and even more weakening when more than one pawn has been advanced.

Other types of structural weakness occur when one of the pawns is either lost or doubled.

Tactics

What exactly are tactics?

Tactics are the short-term exploitation of your opponent’s pieces.

The typical goal is to win material, anything from a pawn to a queen.

Most tactics are based on attacking two things at once.

In essence, a tactic wins because your opponent cannot make two moves in a row to meet both of your threats.

59.

Can you win a game without tactics?

Yes, but victory usually occurs because someone resigns before a decisive tactic.

A player can justifiably give up before a single capture is made.
