# Scripts

Canonical scripts live under subfolders:

- `scripts/books/` — EPUB ingestion + removal helpers
- `scripts/pgn/` — PGN merge/dedupe/clean/filter/diagram helpers
- `scripts/diag/` — diagram debugging utilities
- `scripts/ops/` — operational utilities (misc tooling)

For backward compatibility, the previous script paths under `scripts/` still exist as thin wrappers that forward to the new canonical locations.
