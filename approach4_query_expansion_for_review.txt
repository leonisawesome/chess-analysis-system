Two moves is more than most players can see.

Three moves is about the maximum for serious tournament players.

Yes, when they believe they need to calculate.

I can’t attack without my queen and other pieces.

Why should I want to trade them?

Attacking is one of the three basic ways of winning a chess game.

The other two are amassing a material edge and accumulating positional assets.

A good trade can improve your chances of success in all three ways.

But trades are just trades.

How do they help me win?

There is often a subtle difference between the traded pieces.

If you swap a passive knight for a well-posted knight, this is a plus.

Why do masters make a big deal about pawn structures?

Because structures last so long and influence the pieces so much.

After the first dozen or so moves, pawns typically form a distinct pattern.

Thirty moves later, almost all of the first-rank pieces will probably have been captured.

But much of the pawn structure may remain.

In the middlegame, the structure shows you where to put your rooks, bishops and knights.

A favorable structure makes an attack much more likely to succeed.

The castled position is weakened when any of the pawns that form the protective barrier in front of the king – namely the f-, g- and h-pawns – have advanced.

It is more weakening to advance a pawn two squares than one, and even more weakening when more than one pawn has been advanced.

Other types of structural weakness occur when one of the pawns is either lost or doubled.

Black's game has the disadvantage of his double Q B P, which, to make matters worse, he cannot advance, because as soon as Black plays P - Q Kt 3, White replies P - Q Kt 4.

He will stop Black's Queen's side Pawns from advancing, and will then bring his own King to K 3.

Then in due time he will play P - Q 4, and finally P - K 5, or P - K Kt 5, thus forcing an exchange of Pawns and obtaining in that way a clear passed Pawn on the King's file.

An isolated pawn, like the one at a2, is vulnerable in a middlegame because it is separated by at least one file from other White pawns and cannot be defended by them.

White’s c-pawns are doubled.

They may be easier to defend in a middlegame than isolated pawns.

But it is problematic to create a passed pawn out of them in an endgame.

The g2-pawn is backward because it cannot advance without allowing the Black h-pawn to capture it.

This game constitutes a warning against careless play.

1.Rb8?

After this, the white king is pushed to the back rank and Black wins thanks to the second pawn.

Therefore, the defending king should avoid being pushed to the back rank.

Then the right move is:
1.Rb2!

This set-up is impregnable because Black has no room on the kingside.

It would also work against a central or bishop’s pawn, but it is not so advisable.

Pawns
217.

Why do masters make a big deal about pawn structures?

Because structures last so long and influence the pieces so much.

After the first dozen or so moves, pawns typically form a distinct pattern.

Thirty moves later, almost all of the first-rank pieces will probably have been captured.

But much of the pawn structure may remain.

In the middlegame, the structure shows you where to put your rooks, bishops and knights.

A favorable structure makes an attack much more likely to succeed.

Evaluating

Why is it important to evaluate a position?

When you choose a move to play, you want to know whether it improves your winning chances.

But you can’t know this unless you compare the consequences of that move with the consequences of other moves.

Opponents constantly evaluate moves in a game.

They often come to the same conclusion – up to a point.

One player’s pawn hole is his opponent’s potential outpost.

White to move
An isolated pawn, like the one at a2, is vulnerable in a middlegame because it is separated by at least one file from other White pawns and cannot be defended by them.

White’s c-pawns are doubled.

They may be easier to defend in a middlegame than isolated pawns.

But it is problematic to create a passed pawn out of them in an endgame.

The g2-pawn is backward because it cannot advance without allowing the Black h-pawn to capture it.

The Black f-pawns are the weakest because they are doubled and isolated.

Are the f-pawns also inferior because of the squares they guard?

Sacrificing
253.

Why does a sacrifice make sense?

It means you have less material to attack with.

But not at the area of the board you are attacking.

Compare it with war: A more skillful army may win when it concentrates its forces at an area where a larger army is spread thin.

By giving up some of his material, the sacrificer hopes to generate greater force at that point of attack.

A sacrifice turns “matter into energy,” as a great attacking player of the past, Rudolf Spielmann, put it.

4.7: The Exchange Sacrifice
The ‘exchange’ is the name we give to the difference in value between a rook and a minor piece.

Hence we frequently find in chess books and magazines the expressions “win the exchange”, “sacrificing the exchange”, “the exchange up”, etc.

An exchange sacrifice – giving up a rook for a bishop or a knight – can be an extraordinarily effective way to change the course of a game.

This is partly because players subconsciously regard a well-protected minor piece as immune to the threat of capture by a rook.

This is a vast subject, especially when long-term positional e

The particular weaknesses in the castled position and the precise deployment of the pieces will, in every case, dictate the most effective course of attack.

The sacrifice of a minor piece for one or two pawns, with the added value of the structural damage to the defender’s castled position, is a procedure which is usually effective when the attacker’s remaining pieces are in a position to launch a rapid offensive.

Undoubtedly, rook endings are by far the most important endgames.

There are several reasons for this: first, as we saw in the statistics, they are by far the most common type of endgame.

In addition, they are far more complex and their theory is more abstract (therefore, more boring), and also, the number of important theoretical positions is much higher than in other endgames.
