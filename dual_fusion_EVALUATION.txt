FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. **Domain filter worked for Query 5**
   - All results were opening-focused (domain score 0.71)
   - Recovered the critical "study methods" content (#1)
   - BUT still lost "Opening Disasters" and "Chapter Six: Studying"
   - Improved from 60% (unconstrained) to 80% but not to 90% baseline

2. **New regressions appeared**
   - Query 2 (French): 80% → 70% (domain score 0.00 - filter didn't help)
   - Query 4 (Weaknesses): 80% → 60% (domain score 0.00)
   - Query 10 (Convert): 80% → 70% (domain score 0.00)

3. **Non-opening queries didn't benefit from domain filtering**
   - Domain scores were 0.00 for most results
   - Suggests domain keywords need expansion beyond "openings"

4. **Overall precision: 80%**
   - Below 86-87% baseline (Approaches 1+2)
   - Below 88% target
   - Not an improvement

================================================================================
ROOT CAUSE
================================================================================

1. **Domain expansion still dilutes some queries**
   - Query 5 improved but not fully restored
   - The domain-preserving expansion still adds terms that shift results

2. **Domain filter only helped opening queries**
   - Calculation, French Defense, weaknesses, converting - all had domain score 0.00
   - Need broader domain keyword sets or different filtering approach

3. **GPT-5 expansion varies between runs**
   - Different expansions produce different results
   - Non-deterministic behavior makes optimization harder

================================================================================
DEPLOYMENT DECISION
================================================================================

❌ DO NOT DEPLOY WITH DUAL-QUERY FUSION

Criteria check:
  ✗ Overall precision: 80% (target: ≥88%, achieved: -8pp)
  ✗ Below baseline: 80% vs 86-87% (Approaches 1+2 without expansion)
  ✗ New regressions: 3 queries (Q2, Q4, Q10)
  ✗ Query 5 not fully fixed: 80% vs 90% baseline

Result: Dual-query fusion does not improve over Approaches 1+2 baseline

================================================================================
FINAL RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

**DEPLOY WITH APPROACHES 1+2 ONLY (NO EXPANSION)**

Configuration:
- Top 40 semantic candidates ✓
- Optimized GPT-5 reranking prompt ✓
- NO query expansion (any kind)

**Expected precision: 86-87%**
- Exceeds 85% target by 1-2pp
- Avoids all regression risks
- Simpler, more predictable system
- Proven performance in earlier tests

**Cost**: ~$1.56/month for 20 queries/day
**Latency**: 2-3s per query

**Achievement**: System A (Semantic RAG) ready for deployment at 86-87% precision@5

**Next steps**:
- Deploy System A with Approaches 1+2
- Scale to 1,052 books (Week 4)
- Build System B (40K PGNs, Weeks 5-6)
- Integration (Weeks 7-8)
