How to Calculate Chess Tactics
Valeri Beim
Thinking methods are at the heart of the chess struggle, yet most players devote little conscious effort to improving their calculating ability. Much of the previous literature on the subject has presented idealized models that have limited relevance to the hurly-burly of practical chess, or else provide little more than
ad hoc
suggestions. Here, experienced trainer Valeri Beim strikes a balance by explaining how to use intuition and logic together to solve tactical problems in a methodical way. He also offers advice on when it is best to calculate ‘l

How far ahead do average players see before they make a move?

Two moves is more than most players can see.

Three moves is about the maximum for serious tournament players.

But masters must calculate much further?

Yes, when they believe they need to calculate.

But they make most of their moves without that much look-ahead.

Even elite players are not calculating machines.

Understanding Chess Middlegames
John Nunn
The middlegame is the phase of the chess battle where most games are decided, yet is the one that has received the least systematic treatment from chess writers. With the outstanding clarity for which he is famous, Nunn breaks down complex problems into bite-sized pieces. Each of the 100 lessons features two inspiring examples from modern chess, with a clear focus on the key instructive points.

Fashionable openings go in and out of favour like ageing rock stars, who were huge 40 years ago, but now have trouble selling tickets at the local swap meet.

The point is White’s development lead can be shockingly ineffective, since Black’s position remains target free.

155.

I can’t attack without my queen and other pieces.

Why should I want to trade them?

Attacking is one of the three basic ways of winning a chess game.

The other two are amassing a material edge and accumulating positional assets.

A good trade can improve your chances of success in all three ways.

But trades are just trades.

How do they help me win?

There is often a subtle difference between the traded pieces.

If you swap a passive knight for a well-posted knight, this is a plus.

The castled position is weakened when any of the pawns that form the protective barrier in front of the king – namely the f-, g- and h-pawns – have advanced.

It is more weakening to advance a pawn two squares than one, and even more weakening when more than one pawn has been advanced.

Other types of structural weakness occur when one of the pawns is either lost or doubled.

All you really need to know are some of the positions with relatively little material, such as with fewer than six pieces and pawns.

Don’t worry about the more complex endgames.

Endgames
267.

When does the endgame start?

That’s a simple question and there should be a simple answer.

But we don’t have one.

Among the definitions that have been suggested are:
a) When the kings can safely take part in play,
b) When neither player has more than the equivalent of a queen and a minor piece left, and
c) When the main goal of the players is promoting a pawn.

But one or more of these definitions fail to describe many positions we would definitely call endgames.

Isn’t it always an endgame after the queens are traded?

Secrets of Positional Chess
Dražen Marović
How can one determine if a piece is weak or strong? Or if a square is weak or strong? These are the principal questions that grandmaster and trainer Dražen Marović addresses in this important book. By discussing carefully-chosen games and positions, Marović explains how to recognize good and bad features of positions, and how to make use of one’s advantages and exploit the opponent’s weaknesses.

Improve Your Positional Chess
Carsten Hansen
Throughout a game of chess, we must constantly make judgements and decisions that cannot be determined simply by calculation. We must then rely on our positional judgement. Good positional skills are primarily developed by experience, but they can also be learnt. In this book, Carsten Hansen provides a wealth of advice and ideas that will help give readers a helping-hand up to new levels of positional understanding. Paramount in this discussion is the player’s need to weigh up positional elements at the board, and decide which are most important for

Chapter Seven:
Evaluating
136.

Why is it important to evaluate a position?

When you choose a move to play, you want to know whether it improves your winning chances.

But you can’t know this unless you compare the consequences of that move with the consequences of other moves.

Opponents constantly evaluate moves in a game.

They often come to the same conclusion – up to a point.

If the c-pawn is at c3, not c4, Black might get the upper hand by establishing a blockade with pieces on c4 and d5.

The c4 square can be an ideal outpost for a knight.

What is an outpost?

One player’s pawn hole is his opponent’s potential outpost.

Black’s move in the next diagram is a positional blunder because it hands White an outpost square.

Chapter Twelve:
Sacrificing
253.

Why does a sacrifice make sense?

It means you have less material to attack with.

But not at the area of the board you are attacking.

Compare it with war: A more skillful army may win when it concentrates its forces at an area where a larger army is spread thin.

By giving up some of his material, the sacrificer hopes to generate greater force at that point of attack.

A sacrifice turns “matter into energy,” as a great attacking player of the past, Rudolf Spielmann, put it.

Are there different ways of doing that?

3.5: Passive Sacrifices
The sacrifice of a pawn, sometimes even an important one, can be the very key needed to unlock the enemy position. Many masters have appreciated the effectiveness of this method, even some who are particularly anxious to preserve their material and customarily prefer to win by technical means.
By the term
passive
pawn sacrifice is meant the voluntary abandonment of a pawn – it is simply left to be taken. The reader might not encounter this terminology in the standard chess literature, and it is perhaps not totally accurate, since by the simple fact of offering the pawn

In

a whole chapter was devoted to the various types of knight sacrifice against the opponent’s castled position, with a focus on sacrifices leading to mate.

Here the combinations and their associated finesses expand the field of study to other sacrifices or attacks, with a variety of objectives.

Here it is not a question of all-out mating attacks, but rather of any type of advantage that justifies the combination.

4.7: The Exchange Sacrifice
The ‘exchange’ is the name we give to the difference in value between a rook and a minor piece.

Hence we frequently find in chess books and magazines the expressions “win the exchange”, “sacrificing the exchange”, “the exchange up”, etc.

An exchange sacrifice – giving up a rook for a bishop or a knight – can be an extraordinarily effective way to change the course of a game.

This is partly because players subconsciously regard a well-protected minor piece as immune to the threat of capture by a rook.

This is a vast subject, especially when long-term positional e

This was quite natural, as it is a standard way to launch a mating attack.

Here we shall examine a few more examples, because they illustrate the fact that each position contains its own peculiarities, just as this type of sacrifice, however thematic and well-known it might be, always has to be examined carefully, perhaps with more care than any other combination, precisely because a player familiar with its simple technique can easily overlook some possib

Why do masters say, “Nothing is harder than winning a won game”?

Winning “technique,” as it is called, is difficult to master because it requires skills very different from those used in the other phases of a game.

Instead of accumulating advantages, you need to exploit them.

This is because the defence is quite difficult and, above all, tedious, and when we are tired we can fall into a losing position, or make a gross mistake.

Nowadays, as rates of play get faster and quick-play finishes are the norm, the knowledge of the defensive procedures is a must for a player to hold this endgame in an actual game.

Attacking technique is also difficult, and therefore its prior study is always useful but, since the defender usually fails to find the most tenacious moves, an approximate idea of the winning plan is enough to execute it without precise memorisation.
