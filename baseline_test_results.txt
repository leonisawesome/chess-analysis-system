How to Calculate Chess Tactics
Valeri Beim
Thinking methods are at the heart of the chess struggle, yet most players devote little conscious effort to improving their calculating ability. Much of the previous literature on the subject has presented idealized models that have limited relevance to the hurly-burly of practical chess, or else provide little more than
ad hoc

Viacheslav Eingorn and Valentin Bogdanov
The French appeals to a wide range of chess temperaments: it is solid yet uncompromising, and with a variety of chaotic variations to appeal to the most bloodthirsty of players, but also offering more tranquil lines to those seeking a quieter existence. Chess Explained books provide an understanding of an opening and the middlegames to which it leads, enabling you to find the right moves and plans in your own games.

The castled position is weakened when any of the pawns that form the protective barrier in front of the king – namely the f-, g- and h-pawns – have advanced.

It is more weakening to advance a pawn two squares than one, and even more weakening when more than one pawn has been advanced.

Other types of structural weakness occur when one of the pawns is either lost or doubled.

Some authors claim you must master 100 or more “book” positions to play endgames well.

This is not true.

All you really need to know are some of the positions with relatively little material, such as with fewer than six pieces and pawns.

Don’t worry about the more complex endgames.

Until you are a better than average player, most of your endgames will be pretty one-sided.

Either you or your opponent will probably be a minor piece or several pawns ahead.

The first thing a student should do, is to familiarise himself with the power of the pieces.

This can best be done by learning how to accomplish quickly some of the simple mates.

The principle is to drive the opposing King to the last line on any side of the board

In this position the power of the Rook is demonstrated by the first move, R - R 7, which immediately confines the Black King to the last rank, and the mate is quickly

Improve Your Positional Chess
Carsten Hansen
Throughout a game of chess, we must constantly make judgements and decisions that cannot be determined simply by calculation. We must then rely on our positional judgement. Good positional skills are primarily developed by experience, but they can also be learnt. In this book, Carsten Hansen provides a wealth of advice and ideas that will help give readers a helping-hand up to new levels of positional understanding. Paramount in this discussion is the player’s need to weigh up positional elements at the board, and decide which are most important for

Once you can do that comfortably, try it with two extra pawns.

Why do masters say, “Nothing is harder than winning a won game”?

Winning “technique,” as it is called, is difficult to master because it requires skills very different from those used in the other phases of a game.

Instead of accumulating advantages, you need to exploit them.

If the c-pawn is at c3, not c4, Black might get the upper hand by establishing a blockade with pieces on c4 and d5.

What is an outpost?

One player’s pawn hole is his opponent’s potential outpost.

Sacrificing
253.

Why does a sacrifice make sense?

It means you have less material to attack with.

But not at the area of the board you are attacking.

Compare it with war: A more skillful army may win when it concentrates its forces at an area where a larger army is spread thin.

By giving up some of his material, the sacrificer hopes to generate greater force at that point of attack.

A sacrifice turns “matter into energy,” as a great attacking player of the past, Rudolf Spielmann, put it.

Essential Chess Sacrifices
David LeMoir
Sacrifices are an essential part of chess. Those who never consider sacrificing will miss countless opportunities and find that promising positions repeatedly slip away. Players who do not appreciate their opponents’ sacrificial possibilities will be unable to see danger signs, and find themselves on the wrong end of too many king-hunts. Rather than merely cataloguing the various possibilities and providing examples, LeMoir discusses the possible follow-ups to the sacrifices, the defensive options against them, and the positional factors that might sugge

3.5: Passive Sacrifices
The sacrifice of a pawn, sometimes even an important one, can be the very key needed to unlock the enemy position. Many masters have appreciated the effectiveness of this method, even some who are particularly anxious to preserve their material and customarily prefer to win by technical means.
By the term

pawn sacrifice is meant the voluntary abandonment of a pawn – it is simply left to be taken. The reader might not encounter this terminology in the standard chess literature, and it is perhaps not totally accurate, since by the simple fact of offering the pawn
