{ How should White proceed? What's the right positional continuation for white here ? }
1. e5 $1 Ne8 { ...and now ? } 2. cxd5 $3
{ Once again
putting black a pawn on d5 forever! The fact that Black can win a tempo by threatening our queen is not at all important! }
2... cxd5 3. Qd3 $16 ( 3. Qa4 Bc6 4. Qb3 $16 ) 3... Nc7 4. Rfc1 $1
{ Now we reach a classic setup with d4, e5 against e6, d5, where Black's minor pieces are packed
on the seventh rank. Vorobiov-Shanava 2010  (1-0) }
