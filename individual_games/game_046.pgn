{ Again, we see a game by Gabriel Sargissian, a great strategist who excels at finishing technical positions without difficulty. }

{ White is expanding space. This strategic idea frequently appears in the Queen's
Gambit when the bishop is developed to f4. }
7... Nh5 8. Bd3
{ White can allow the capture on f4, as the pawn on f4 will gain even more support for
the e5 square. If Black cannot push e5, the only way to develop the c8 bishop is via a6. }
(
{ If White were to retreat the bishop, the control
of the e5 square would be lost. }

{ Black currently controls the a-file, but White is about to take it, since Black must transfer
the rook to c8 to keep control. This can only happen after the queen is relocated. }

kingside is now secure, allowing White to continue the attack on the queenside. }
