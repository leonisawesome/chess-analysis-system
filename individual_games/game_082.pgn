1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. a3
{ The Saemisch Variation is an agressive system, where White immediately creates several imbalances.
White gets the pair of bishops, and will occupy the centre with pawns, but, to get this, he has to accept doubled pawns on the c-file. }

{ An unusual move instead of the normal 7.Bd3. } 7... d6 8. Ng3 e5 ( 8... h5 $5
{ is best in my opinion. } ) 9. d5 Na5
{ If Black is not certain, if ...Na5 is the theoretical move, he should prefer ...Ne7! In this case, White is in time to protect c4,
after which the a5-knight will turn out to be badly placed. }

kingside. }

manage to put a knight on e5. Still, Black should have taken on f4 in my opinion. }

the 2nd rank. } (
14. f5 $1
{ gaining, even more space on the kingside, was best. White will prepare, g4-g5, while Black is without
counterplay. }
