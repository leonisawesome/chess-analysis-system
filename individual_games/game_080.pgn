{ It’s Black to move. How should the attack continue? How should Black continue in this strange position? }
1... Nxg1 2. Nxh2 Nf3+ $1 3. Bxf3 gxf3 $19
{ By this combination, Black opens the c8-h3 diagonal, allowing the queen to penetrate White's camp. Black's huge space advantage is
offering him an easy win, including some unusual ideas that cannot be found in more 'normal' positions! }
4. Nf1 Qh3 $1 5. Bc3 Ke7 $3 6. a5 Kf6 $1 7. Qd2 Kg5 $1 8. Qd1 Qg2 $1 $19
{ Huynh-Brown 2018 (0-1) and the black king is slowly coming to g2! If White tries to escape with Kd2,
his f2 pawn is dropping! }
