{ Black is better due to his extra space in the center. However, White has a positional threat that could make his position more tenable. How
should White continue after, for example, 1... Ng6? What is the best response for Black instead? }
1... Ng6 $6 ( 1... a6 $3 $19
{ Keeping play
on both sides of the board! (game Sandalakis A -Papaioannou 2021 0-1) }
) 2. a5 $1
{ and now White has some hope, as Black's play on the
queenside has come to an end! }
2... b6 ( 2... a6 3. b6 $15 ) 3. a6 Qd7 4. O-O-O $15 *
