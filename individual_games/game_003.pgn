{ In this position, Black has two continuations: 7...d5, transitioning
into a Catalan-type structure, and 7...a5, aiming to gain space on the queenside. }

this move, White gains space on the queenside and aims to play a4 and a5. }

White's target of attack. } ) 10. Bc3 Nbd7 11. Re1 Qb8 12. Bf1
{ Now, Black needs to take immediate action in the center to prevent White from
executing the e4 break without any difficulty. The passive }
( 12. Bh3 ) 12... Re8 $2

obstacles. Black had two continuations. }

{ White is clearly more comfortable here, with a big space advantage and the bishop pair on top of that. So, how should Black continue from
here? Let’s take a look at some options: }
14... e5 ( 14... c5 15. bxc5
{ This is the best and simplest move. White maintains the space advantage,
and in case the center becomes blocked, the bishops remain active. }

option for White. } ) ) ( 14... d5 15. cxd5 exd5

the question arises whether White should push e5 or strengthen the center with f3. }

{ This is a great advantage for White. White can play on the kingside with the plan to push f4,
or even on the queenside with a4 and a5. }

{ Enjoying a lead in space. } ( 19. b5
{ In this way, White has taken control of
the entire board. Now White can transfer the pieces to the kingside and gradually start an attack on that wing. Black does have a nice
outpost for the knight on c5, but that is insufficient to save the game. }

queenside is blocked and, having captured the h4 pawn, makes a timely push with g5. }
