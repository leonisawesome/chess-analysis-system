{ White captures the knight with the idea that a bad bishop can be superior to a good knight. In this particular case,
however, White wants to gain space swiftly with e4 and e5 }

{ The bishop on e3 is solid. It supports the d4
pawn, and if Black tries Ne7 and Nf5, White can easily reposition the bishop to f2. }

{ It's key not to ruin the pawn structure if
Black takes on c3. } 13... Nge7

superior to bishops in closed positions, but in this case, the knights lack strong squares where they can be placed. }
