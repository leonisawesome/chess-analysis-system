{ Black needs to be careful — White has a strategic threat. What would you play for Black? Here, Black played 1...Rc8 - do you agree with
this move or could he have done better? }
1... Rc8 $2 ( 1... cxd4 $1 { was a much better move! } 2. cxd4 exd4 $1 $132 (
2... Qc7 $5 ) 3. Nxd4 Nc6 { With equal chances for both sides. } ) 2. d5 $1
{ Now White has a significant strategic advantage. And now white has som advantage because of
the extra space in the center ...and mainly because of the bad Na5! Navara-Mamedyarov 2016 (1-0) }
