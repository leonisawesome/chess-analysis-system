{ In chess, space advantage refers to the control of more squares on the board, particularly in the opponent’s half. A player with greater
space has more room to maneuver pieces, launch attacks, and restrict the opponent’s options. This concept is especially important in the
middlegame, where spatial control can translate into long-term strategic pressure. Gaining space is often achieved through pawn advances
that secure key central or flank squares, limiting the mobility of the opponent’s pieces. However, maintaining a space advantage requires
careful planning, as overextending can lead to weaknesses. Understanding how to create, maintain, and exploit space advantage is a
fundamental aspect of high-level chess strategy. }
