{ In Lesson 3, we focus on positions with a space advantage on the wings: 1) White establishes a space advantage on the kingside by playing
f4-f5 (or Black ...f5-f4). 2) Space advantage on the queenside with a white pawn on b6(!). 3) White plays g2-g4 in the King's Indian. 4)
White plays Nd5 in the Sicilian Najdorf or Sveshnikov. }
