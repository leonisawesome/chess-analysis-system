{ A typical position from the Caro-Kann, 2.d3 Variation. What should Black play? }
1... a4 $1 $17
{ Black gains space and fixes the b2 pawn,
which will inevitably become a weakness if White proceeds with Gainning space and fixing white's queenside! }
2. b4 axb3 $1 3. cxb3 Bg4 $17
{ Black creatively brought the rook into play, and now it’s eyeing the pawn on a3. With the central advantage and superior piece placement,
Black is better. Ljubojevic-Karpov 1992 (0-1) }
