{ It’s natural to consider taking space with d4-d5 here, but that could
also backfire for White. Black can simplify by exchanging a piece and then begin targeting the weak points at the base of White’s pawn
chain. }

we can see, White has more space, but Black still stands better. } ) 8...

{ The white pawns in the center have also become targets of
attack. } ) 12. h3

15. d5 Nc4
{ With the knight moving to b6 after b3, Black then has
the opportunity to attack with a5 followed by a4. Alternatively, after Nb6, Black can also advance with c4, then after b4, a5 would be a
move. }

{ This is a typical idea. White plays a4 before Black plays a5. Now the options of capturing on b5 arise, followed by Karpov-style
moves like Be3, and sometimes Ba7, followed by doubling on the a-file. }

that Black cannot reach f5, and White therefore decides to block the queenside. }
