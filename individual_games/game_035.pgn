{ White to move. How can we prevent Black from getting any counterplay while making use of the space advantage? How did the great Anatoly
Karpov continue with White? How did he exploit his extra space advantage in the centre }

{ At this point, Black
holds complete dominance. The spatial advantage grants him flexibility to play on both wings. This is the game Ljubojević vs. Karpov,
Tilburg 1993, which Karpov decisively resolved in his favor, employing his typical strategic precision. Black is much better due to his
extra space in the center ....but mainly due to the fact that he has already opened the play on the queenside while white is very slow with
his kingside play! (Ljubojevic-Karpov 1992 0-1 ) }
( { It was also possible to play immediately } 2... Nc5 $1
{ is also very good } 3. Qb1 Nfd7 $17 ) *
