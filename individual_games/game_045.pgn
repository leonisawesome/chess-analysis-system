{ While Black has managed to exchange several pieces, the knight on a6 and White's strong
control of the center are sufficient to secure White's advantage in this position. }
17... d5 18. cxd5 cxd5 19. e5
{ A good decision by White. Now
we have the typical pawn structure with pawns on d4 and e5 against d5 and e6. Such positions occur in many openings, for example, the French
Defense, the Caro-Kann, the Catalan, and many others. As we know, every pawn move creates weaknesses. In this case, the squares behind the
pawns are weak. The question arises whether the pieces can control those squares, and whether those squares are important — that is, whether
the game will focus on them, or if the game will take a different direction. }
19... Nc7 { Black defends the b5 square and repositions his knight. } 20. Rac1
Qd7 21. Rc2 Rbc8 22. Rfc1
{ In games with lower-rated players, simple plans are often ignored. Here, White plays simply along the
c-file, which may give him an advantage. }
22... Nb5 $2 23. Nxb5 Rxc2 24. Rxc2 Qxb5 25. Rc7
{ Now that White controls the c-file and has a spatial
advantage, he has good prospects for a win. }
25... a5 26. Qc2
{ This move keeps the Black king from finding any breathing room. } 26... h6

{ Black is now in a position where he can't play any useful moves. White should place his
pieces on key squares and start the attack, but first, he needs to ensure the safety of his king. }
38. Qc6 Qb8 ( 38... Qxc6 39. Rxc6 Rb8 40. f5
{ In this position, White can certainly engage in complications. White has a more active king, a better-positioned rook, and his pawns are
closer to promotion. }
