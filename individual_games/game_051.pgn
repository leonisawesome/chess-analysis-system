{ The London System is popular today, but this old mainline
variation is no longer seen at the highest levels. }
8. Bd3 b6 9. e4 Be7 10. e5
{ As we have observed numerous times, the side with the
spatial advantage typically seeks to consolidate its pieces and deny counterplay. The opposing side must take immediate and concrete actions
to neutralize this advantage. }
10... Nh5 ( 10... Nd7 11. h4
{ At this point, White is threatening to play Lxh7 with Sg5, creating checkmate threats.
Another idea is a3 followed by b4. }

his bad light-squared bishop. }

{ Although Black traded his light-squared bishop,
White's dark-squared bishop is still dangerous, because the black pawn on g6 lets White play on the black light squares. }
22... Rfc8 23. Bf4 Na5 24. Bg5 ( 24. h5 $16
{ According to the engine, this is the optimal move. White keeps the tension and can choose at the right moment whether
to push h6 or capture on g6. }
