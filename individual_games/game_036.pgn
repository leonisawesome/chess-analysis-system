{ White to move. How can we prevent Black from getting any counterplay while making use of the space advantage? How did the great Anatoly
Karpov continue with White? How did he exploit his extra space advantage in the center? }

{ Three
excellent, connected moves, all aimed at one goal: complete domination. White has blocked Black on the queenside, and while the White king
might seem vulnerable, it is, in fact, perfectly safe. Now, the action moves to the kingside, where the game turns into a one-sided attack.
By blocking the queenside and castling long...in order to attack against the black King!  (game Karpov-Jussupow 1993) }
