{ White has an extra tempo in this position, but since it’s of a more
static nature, that tempo doesn’t make much of a difference. }

{ White
is in a better position here. Whether to recapture on d5 with the e-pawn, c-pawn, or knight is just a matter of taste. }
14... cxd5 15. Nxd5
{ White
currently has a powerful knight on d5, which can be driven away with e6, but then the pawn on d6 will become weak. }
15... e6 16. Nc3 Bc6 17. Nd4 Qe7 18. Bg5 f6
{ We’re now looking at a Maroczy-type structure where White enjoys a significant advantage. Black is burdened with too many
weaknesses. To sum up what happened: the white pawn on d5 was a major problem for Black. Black postponed central activity for too long and
was eventually forced to push the e-pawn — but by that point, it was already too late. From there, the position continued to deteriorate. }
19. Be3 Rad8 20. Rcd1 Rd7 21. f3 Qf7 22. b3
{ Black would love to rewind and put the pawn back on f7 — but that ship has sailed. }
22... f5 23. exf5
{ In the Maroczy, you almost always take on f5 — that’s the standard reply. Doing so creates new weaknesses for Black, especially down the
e-file. Ultimately, Grischuk converted the advantage and won the game. }
