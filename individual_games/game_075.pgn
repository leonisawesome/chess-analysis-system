{ White has complete control over the board. As we discussed, having a spatial advantage alone isn’t enough for victory; there are other
strategic components to consider. What’s the best plan for White? White has a big space advantage. How can she improve the position even
further? }

{ Great
manoeuvre. White brings in the last piece to a key strategic position. The ...a5-a4 advance has been prevented forever, and White may turn
his full attention to the kingside! }
