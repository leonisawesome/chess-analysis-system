{ The center is blocked, but White holds a space advantage. However, caution is needed. What’s the next move for White? How should White
continue in this position ? }
1. g4 $3
{ White doesn't care about opening the king. His space advantage lets him play these moves. }
( 1. Be3 $6 f5 $1 $132 ) ( 1. Qe2 $6 f5 $1 $132 ) 1... Rac8 ( 1... f5 2. g5 $1
$16
{ Thats the big difference when we play g4! ...now we can gain a lot of
space with g5! }
) 2. h5 $14
{ As we've noted, the pawn structure of h5, g4, f4, e5 against h6, g7, f7, e6 usually favors White.

( 2. Be3 $1 $16 { It is also a good choice. } ) *
