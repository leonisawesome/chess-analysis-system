{ It's Black to move - evaluate 1...h5 and 1...Nc5 . } 1... h5 $1
{ 1...h5! is a very good move! Gaining space on the kingside and creating
fast counterplay! }
( 1... Nc5 $2
{ Karjakin-Giri 2019 - 1...Nc5? is a bad move, because White will soon gain extra space on the queenside
with a gain of a tempo! }
