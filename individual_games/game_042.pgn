{ The most frequently played move is } 7... Nc6 ) 8. Nxd4
{ Now the
game transitions into a Maroczy structure, with White enjoying a space advantage thanks to pawns on c4 and e4, facing Black’s pawn on d6. }
8... Nc6 9. Qd2
{ White has the option to launch an attack on Black’s king or to seek opportunities in the endgame. These are typical plans in
these kinds of positions. }
9... Nxd4
{ Exchanging pieces when space is limited is a principle we have mentioned often. }
10. Bxd4 Be6 11. Rc1
{ White initially secures the queenside in order to respond to ...Nd7 with Be3, thereby preserving the bishop’s presence in the game. }
11... Rc8 12. b3 Qa5 13. Be2 Rfd8 ( 13... a6 14. Na4
{ White utilizes control over the weak b6 square and seeks to initiate a queen exchange. }
) 14. Be3 a6 ( 14... Nd7
{ The question arises whether White should now attack on the kingside with g4 or h4. The answer is no, because that would give

{ This move is inaccurate, as it allows White to expand further on the kingside. }
( 16... Bd7 $5 ) ( 16... Nxd5 17. cxd5 Bd7
{ This was the best method to equalize the position. Suppose White succeeds in exchanging the dark-squared
bishops, leaving only the light-squared bishops on the board. }
18. Bd4 { Just to illustrate that scenario. } 18... Kf8 19. Bxg7+ Kxg7
{ White stands
a bit better here, despite having all his pawns on light squares. The important thing is that, except for the d5 pawn, White’s pawns are
flexible and can advance onto dark squares. }
) 17. Nb6 Rc7 18. g4 Nd7 ( 18... Bxg4 $2
{ This is not a good move, but we have to consider these
moves. } 19. fxg4

the knight. }
