{ In the second part of Space Advantage, we will discuss positions that come from different openings or pawn structures, like the Maroczy
Bind, the blockaded structure in the French Defense, and the pawn setup of d4 and e5 against d5 and e6 in the center, which can also arise
from other openings. Another goal is to grasp when a space advantage has a role to play in the endgame. }
