7... Nc6 { is better. } ) 8. O-O Re8
{ Who can find the best move
for White in this theoretical, but not very common position? }
9. Nd2 $1
{ This, in connection with the next move, is best. White has to play
e4, as otherwise Black would play ...e5-e4 and get the advantage. }

{ White does not need to fear } 14... b5 15. cxb5 Bxb5 16. c4 $16

{ Due to the threat of Bb2, Black
loses material. } ) 14. d5 Nb8 15. f4
{ White starts playing on the kingside. Black's extra pawn does not play a role, and the rook on a3 is
excellently placed! }
15... Na6 ( { After } 15... exf4 16. gxf4 $18
{ White's rook can be transferred to the kingside via the erd rank. } ) 16. f5
$18
{ White has tremendous compensation for the pawn thanks to his huge space advantage. }
