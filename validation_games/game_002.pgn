{ Normally, if White starts the game with the move 1.d4, White should, in most cases,
have a slight space advantage. }

{ In this case,
White would gain space but would weaken the dark squares in the long run. Therefore, it is better to castle and reroute the knight to d5. }

Nb8 9. Nc3 ( 9. d6 $14 ) 9... d6 10. Nge2
{ The knight on f3 doesn’t
have much potential, so c2 is the ideal square. White’s strategy involves gaining space on the kingside with h3 and g4. Eventually, the
knight may move to g3. }
10... a5 { It gains space and controls the c5 square for the knight. } 11. h3
Na6
{ This move is much more flexible than Nbd7
because Black can transfer the knight to c5 whenever they wish. }
12. g4 h6 13. Ng3 Nc5 14. O-O-O
{ Having more space allows us to risk more
and opt for more decisive actions. }

{ A strong, quiet move. White aims to advance f4. The queen on c2 watches over e4. }
16... g6 17. f4 O-O 18. f5
{ Initially, it seems that White's bishop is far inferior to Black's, but White's pawns limit Black's light-squared bishop,
making the bishops equally strong or equally weak. }
18... Kg7 ( 18... g5 ) 19. e4
{ In this setup, it would be preferable for Black if the b6 pawn
was placed on b7, as the c6 move is hard to make with all queen-side pawns positioned on dark squares }
19... g5 { Finding a plan for Black is
challenging. } 20. Bf3 Rh8 21. Rh2 Ng8

Rxh4 Nb7 $2 29. Qc2
{ White
could have transferred his worst piece, the bishop on e2, through d3 and c2 to a4 to trade off the bad bishop. In chess, principles often
coincide. For instance, one principle suggests exchanging your weakest piece, whereas another recommends keeping pieces on the board if you
have a space advantage. When principles collide, we must rely on positional evaluation to determine which principle takes priority. }

so much space that he can afford to sacrifice the exchange. }

{ White picks the perfect
moment to play this move. White plans to put the bishop on b5 and create a mating threat. }
