{ This is a game I played during the 2014 Olympiad in Tromsø. My opponent was Emilio Cordova, a grandmaster from Peru, who played a weak
opening. }
1. d4 $1 Nf6 2. c4 b6 { This is a very risky opening. } 3. Nc3 Bb7 4. Qc2
{ I believe this is the strongest move, and it’s been
played by none other than Anand himself. }
( 4. f3 d5 $132 ) 4... d6
{ How to respond to such moves? White shouldn’t worry about being
surprised in the opening, but should simply stick to principles and take control of the center. }

{ This is likely the best move. } 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. e4 Nxc3 7. bxc3
{ What we have here looks like the Petrosian line in the Queen’s Indian — except the pawn isn't on a3. That’s great for us. We skip
that move, play something like Bd3, and enjoy the same setup with an extra tempo in hand. }

{ The
bishop on b7 is restricted and lacks activity, while White enjoys a space advantage. }

$17 { does not work in this position - Black is too active. } ) ) 7. Nf3 g6 8.
Be2 Bg7 9. O-O O-O
{ The problem with this
position is that Black still hasn’t moved the e-pawn. The more moves we play, the harder it will be for Black to play e6 or e5, because
White will capture on e6, leaving the e6 and d6 pawns weak. }
10. Bf4
{ White should play normal developing moves. This move focuses on
controlling d6, effectively preventing Black from advancing the e-pawn anymore. }

{ Black again faces problems due to lack of space. Now he is even losing the
f-pawn. }
14... Nf7 15. exf5 gxf5 16. Qxf5 (
{ If that pawn can be defended, from a purely positional view, Black is still in trouble because the
e-pawn and the e6 square have become weaknesses. }

nice move aimed at advancing the f-pawn. Now White has a winning position. }
