all. How should White continue? }

{ This position is very bad for Black. Why would anybody accept such a pawn and be forced for the remainder of the game? White has an
advantage in development and a permanent space advantage. }

8. f5
{ A
high-level move, after which White is better. Black is up a pawn, but he cannot create counterplay, and White has a significant space
advantage. Black's extra pawn (the b7-pawn) does not play a role for the time being. }

option. } ( 9. Nf3
