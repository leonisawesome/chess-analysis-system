{ [%cal Gh1g1] with promising chances for an
attack. Without the pawn on d5, or if that pawn were instead on d3, White would have no realistic chances for an attack, as Black would
swiftly dominate the center. Thus, possessing a space advantage is an important precondition for launching a successful attack on the
king. }

{ Once again, White has a spatial advantage. It is
important to emphasize that a space advantage gives us greater maneuvering possibilities for the pieces. For example, in this position,
White’s bishop can go to d3, then to c2, allowing White to prepare b3, a3, and b4. White also has a wide choice of squares on the second and
third ranks, especially the g3 square, which can serve as a springboard for a knight to f5 later on. On the other hand, Black lacks
sufficient space for his pieces and consequently has no good squares from which to initiate any meaningful action. }

Qxc8 13. g4 Nc5 14. f3
{ White's position is already strategically winning, with the space
advantage being the key factor. }
14... f6
{ The bishop on g7 functions more like a large pawn. Black allowed White to carry out his plan, and now
that bishop is suffering as a result. }

{ A very important move. It’s crucial to remember that when we have a space advantage, we
should generally avoid exchanging pieces. The opponent’s pieces are more cramped due to the lack of space. }

{ White is once again exerting pressure on both flanks. The f5-square is firmly
in White’s hands, and an invasion via the queenside is drawing near. }
