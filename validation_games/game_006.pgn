{ This line is not commonly
seen at top-level play, but it is still playable for Black. }
12. d5 Bd7 ( 12... Nd7
{ This is another plan for Black, involving repositioning
the knight to b6 first, followed by Bd7. }

{ Here, Black should go for the classic Rubinstein plan. } 14... Ne8 15. Nf1 g6
16. g4 Ng7 17. Ng3 f6 18. Be3 Nd8 19. Qd2 Nf7
{ According to the engine, this position is bad for Black, but from a practical
standpoint, it's still playable. }
) 15. a4 Rfc8 16. c4
{ We can now see the strategic issue behind 14...a5. White is ready to block the
queenside completely and start building up pressure on the kingside, where his position is more dominant. }

Rcb8 20. Bc3 Nh7 ( { If } 20... Rb4 21. N3d2 $16
{ [%cal Gf1e3] White doesn't have to take the rook on b4
immediately. He can first consolidate, and then the capture on b4 will become a real threat. }
) 21. Ne3 Ng5 22. Nd2
{ Like we said before,
maintaining a space advantage means avoiding piece exchanges to keep your positional edge. }
22... f6
{ In this position, it’s hard to say that
Black can resist White, but with this move, Black further restricts his bishop by closing its last remaining diagonal. }
23. Nb1 { Brilliant
idea moving the knight to b5 and locking down the b-file. }
23... Ndf7 24. Na3 Qc8 25. h4 Nh7 26. Nb5
{ White’s taken control on the queenside and
kingside. Black’s only chance is a huge blunder by White. }
