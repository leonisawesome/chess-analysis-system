{ White also benefits from a powerful passed pawn on the sixth rank. In such
positions, it is essential not to exchange queens, as doing so would allow Black's king to activate. Keeping the queens on the board gives
White the opportunity to launch an attack on the king and exploit Black's weaknesses. }
