Foreword to the English Edition
When I started playing chess in March 1979 in Riga, everything about the game was associated with Mikhail Tal in my city. Especially a few months later, after Tal’s victories in Montreal and the Riga Interzonal.
However, when you start you’re not necessarily connected to the top yet. You play in your family, go to chess school and learn simple things about the game.
Being passionate about reading I tried not to miss any book or chess magazine from my father’s library. For some reason, Tal and Damsky’s book
Attack with Mikhail Tal
was not there but... the small book on Tal by Alexander Koblenz that you now hold in your hands turned out to be the perfect substitute!
A special memory from the book is those lines that might easily go unnoticed:
After playing a tournament game, he would stay in the Riga chess club until late evening, giving improvised simultaneous displays and playing innumerable casual games.
Leaving the club late, Misha was full of excitement. With his cap askew and his coat fluttering in the wind, he would walk about the Riga streets with his friends, who were chess lovers as passionate as him.
“Of course, you should have played knight f3 to e5; if he captured that knight, a sacrifice on f7 would decide things...” The words, intelligible only to other chess players, rang in the air. The occasional passers-by would stop, look at those oddballs, and shake their heads in confusion...
I vividly recall my own post-mortems. Did I stay in the chess school until everyone had finished? Of course I did! Would I also walk back with friends? Yes! But something was different. More than 30 years after Tal’s teenage years Riga had grown into a pretty big city and the young players mainly lived in different districts. So we only managed a short exchange of words with an ice-cream and... tram number 6 or bus number 16 and so on. Until the next day. No deep analysis, everyone was just relying on their knowledge.
The most important part of Koblenz’s book for me was my impatient desire to repeat Tal’s path to the top, which reading the book sounded simple: even the game annotations looked easy. OK, today we see with the computer that those sometimes brief comments are not always accurate, but I believe that’s of minor importance.
It was another 2-3 years before I got to know Koblenz, and a little later (still being extremely shy) Mikhail Tal himself. However, my path had been marked out much earlier and it was thanks to this book on Tal’s street fights.
Thinking about the past, I realize that the biggest treasure that chess players possessed (and I was one of the last players to get the grandmaster title without computer preparation) was chess emotions. When searching for the truth, you knew that it might not be the ultimate truth, so emotions were the direct bridge from your knowledge to intuition.
The union of Alexander Koblenz and Mikhail Tal was a very emotional one, and reading the book you barely notice how hard their work together on chess was. You read short notes on Tal’s almost irrational chess and only between the lines realize how accurately Koblenz and Tal analyzed positions of adjourned games (for example, against Spassky or Botvinnik), and how serious their opening preparation was. Koblenz didn’t provide any concrete insights on how to become a grandmaster, he only wrote a sincere story which highly inspired me.
I am very happy that this old but highly instructive book is finally out in English. The old Russian edition has always been a special treasure for me and I truly enjoyed reading it through again (yes, the original version without editor’s notes, though I have seen those as well) before writing these few lines.

Introduction
The name of the ex-world champion Mikhail Tal is famous in the chess world. His games, rapid ascension and world championship win, and then the return match loss, have been widely discussed. The interest in the Riga grandmaster is understandable – no chess player before him has managed to climb to the very top of chess Olympus so soon.
Tal’s successes were explained in various ways. Some talked about his special playing style and exceptional luck that accompanied him in tournaments. Others pointed out his “Mozart-like” lightness and even “demonic strength”, which supposedly allowed him to achieve great success without much effort. I must immediately disappoint those who opened this book in search for sensations: no “Tal enigma” has ever existed. The talented player’s way to the top was difficult and full of trials and tribulations. This book will tell you about the stages along this way, the wins and losses, the fulfilled hopes and disappointments.
Twelve Years Ago
Assembly hall of Riga Middle School number 22. A thin boy with a shy smile approaches the demonstration board. He quickly moves a piece. Black’s reply, another move – the solution is correct!
I remember that it wasn’t the quickness of the solution that most impressed me, but a drastic change I saw in the boy as soon as he approached the board. He transformed completely. The smile on his face immediately disappeared, he became incredibly serious.
Later, I learned that Misha was a goalkeeper in his class football team, school checkers champion and one of the most active members of the Young Pioneers’ Palace chess circle. He was also an avid piano player, his favorite composers being Tchaikovsky and Chopin.
The young Tal studied well, but his mathematics teacher was unhappy: Misha preferred to solve everything in his mind, without writing anything in the exercise book. However, he would make exceptions for the boys from senior classes who’d approach him during the break.
“Misha, quick, help me solve this!”
And, even though it was much more interesting to play football in the courtyard, he would pick up a pencil and quickly write down columns of numbers.
Tal’s memory has been exceptional since childhood. During the 24th Soviet chess championship, master Aivars Gipslis and I jokingly asked Misha, “Do you remember which line Keres played in the Queen’s Gambit against Boleslavsky in the third round of the 20th Soviet championship?”
“Stop pulling my leg,” the grandmaster answered. “Boleslavsky played Keres in round 19, not round 3. It was Boleslavsky who had white, and he played the Ruy Lopez.”
The passionate, selfless enthusiasm for chess struggle has never left Tal ever since he learned chess. After playing a tournament game, he would stay in the Riga chess club until late evening, giving improvised simultaneous displays and playing innumerable casual games.
Leaving the club late, Misha was full of excitement. With his cap askew and his coat fluttering in the wind, he would walk about the Riga streets with his friends, who were chess lovers as passionate as him.
“Of course, you should have played knight f3 to e5; if he captured that knight, a sacrifice on f7 would decide things...” The words, intelligible only to other chess players, rang in the air. The occasional passers-by would stop, look at those oddballs, and shake their heads in confusion...
And his mother would call the club yet again: “Do you know if Misha has finished his game? He hasn’t eaten his lunch yet...”
In one such evening, Misha managed to win a truly brilliant game. Here’s the finale of the game played at the 1949 youth tournament in Riga.
No. 1
M. Tal – A. Leonov
1949, Riga, Junior Tournament, round 7
19.Rf6!
A great blockading move. White parries the threat f7-f5 and, in his turn, threatens 20.Rxh6.
19...Qf8
19...Nxf6 didn’t help, because after 20.exf6 gxf6 21.Qxh6 f5, white wins with 22.Ng4!. After 19...gxf6, there’s 20.exf6 Nxf6 21.Qxh6 Qf8 22.Qxf6 Rd7 23.Ng4 Qg7 24.Qh4, with an unstoppable attack.
Editor’s note:
According to the computer, in the line shown by Koblenz black’s play can be radically improved with 21...Ne4!! (instead of 21...Qf8, which is actually a mistake) 22.Bxe4 f5, and after 23.Bxf5 exf5 24.Nxd5 Re6 25.Qg5+ Rg6 26.Ne7+ Kg7 27.Nxg6 Qxg6 28.Qe7+ Qf7 black can hold. However, instead of 20.exf6, white should play 20.Bxh7+, which is winning – 20...Kxh7 21.Ng4 Qf8 22.Rf1 f5 23.Nf6+ Kh8 24.Rf3 (threatening Rf3-g3-g8+) 24...Qg7 25.Rg3!+–.
20.Rf4! Bd7 21.Ng4 Be8 22.Nf6+! Nxf6 23.exf6 Rc7 24.fxg7 Kxg7 25.Qe5+ Black resigned.
The passion for chess didn’t stop Tal from graduating from high school ahead of time (he absorbed the whole elementary school program in just one year), and then from Latvian State University, where he majored in literature.
Tal already realized in his youth that to be successful in chess, it’s necessary to work very hard. This means studying theory, analyzing games of masters and grandmasters, playing through your own games, and learning from your mistakes.
But he had no time for that. School during the days, tournaments in the evenings, so he could only study theory at night.
“Come to our home,” Misha’s father would invite me, “perhaps you can reason with him? He read chess books until morning again.”
Once, during a walk, I seized the moment and tried to prove the importance of a correct daily regimen to Misha. He listened intently, keeping a polite silence.
“I’m sure you’ll become a master,” I said in the end, “but to achieve real success in chess, you need health.”
We said our goodbyes, and I sighed with relief: I had seemingly managed to convince him.
However, Misha’s father called me again the next morning...
The worries of his father, an old, respected doctor, were understandable. We had to influence the young enthusiast in some way. However, the circle of the talented teenager’s interests was very wide, and the desire to understand the mysteries of chess art became a real passion. Later, I came to the conclusion that this full mental burden gave Tal what he wanted the most – a feeling of deep internal satisfaction.
Even now, Tal loathes any kind of “quiet” rest. In all the years I’ve known him, I’ve never seen him at rest. Tal is busy at any time of day: he writes an article, or discusses the new issue of
Sahs
, or analyzes some game, or prepares for a lecture...
Before the 25th Soviet chess championship, Tal went to Kemeri to rest a bit. However, he only managed to stay at the resort for three days and then “fled” back to Riga.
This mental overexertion, this inability to spare himself, was always Tal’s Achilles heel. Perhaps this was one of the main reasons for his collapse which left both specialists and casual fans of the young grandmaster mystified.
Years of Trials
After Tal defeated Botvinnik and became world champion, many were sure that his brilliant chess abilities must have manifested themselves when he was a small child. However, Misha’s first steps in chess were no different from anyone else’s. He would constantly lose to his cousin, a regular chess opponent of his, and get very frustrated afterwards.
Misha achieved fourth category at the age of 11, and second category two years later. Soon, Mikhail was called up to the Latvian youth team. He played on last board, and the result – one win, two draws, and one loss – showed that he didn’t deserve a higher place in the team.
In 1950, the young player earned first category. The next year, he took part in his first adult tournaments – the championships of Latvia and Riga – and only shared 11th and 14th places.
Tal was especially “unlucky” in the openings. He would often get a difficult, hard-to-defend position right from the outset.
However, even back then the young chess player showed his ability to quickly and precisely calculate lines, attack ingeniously and search for hidden tactical resources in a difficult position.
The finale of the game played in the 1951 Latvian championship was very characteristic.
No. 2
A. Strautmanis – M. Tal
1951, Riga, Latvian Championship
White has put a lot of pressure on the c6 pawn. It looks like black will have a hard time avoiding defeat, however, he finds a way to save the game.
17...Ne4! 18.f3
18.Rxc6 is of course bad due to 18...Nc5!
18...Nd6 19.Rxc6 Nc4
Looks like a blunder...
20.R6xc4 b5! 21.Rxc8 bxa4 22.R8c7 Qe8 23.Rxa7 Bd8
It was better to put the bishop on d6.
Editor’s note:
Koblenz’s recommended move 23...Bd6 is better because it prevents white from invading the eighth rank with his rooks.
24.Ra8
Editor’s note:
24.Rc8 was worth considering, to split the duties of the two rooks: one of them would seize the eighth rank, while the other attacked the a4 pawn.
24...Qb5 25.Rcc8 Be7 26.Rxf8+ Bxf8 27.Kf2
, and the game ended in a
draw.
In the autumn of the same year, Misha played in an All-Union youth tournament and scored just 3.5 points out of 9. He performed better in the 1952 Latvian SSR Championship: he took 7th place, and became the republic’s champion the following year.
“You shouldn’t make so many sacrifices,” the team captain advised Tal before he headed to Kharkov for a youth tournament. Tal knew that his penchant for daring attacks and risky combinations would cause concern.
“At first, I tried not to take risks,” Tal recalled, “and played quietly. But then I just couldn’t help it. I got an inviting opportunity in a game against an Uzbekistan player...”
International master Rashid Nezhmetdinov told me what happened in that game.
“During that tournament, I acted as the Russian SFSR team coach. Then master V. Tarasov ran up to me and said, ‘Look what the little Tal is doing! He sacrificed a queen. Incredible!’ We rushed up to the table.”
No. 3
I. Birbrager – M. Tal
1953, Kharkov, 20th Soviet Team Championship, round 5
25...Qxf3
Editor’s note:
Analysis shows that after 25...Bxg4!! 26.Rxg4 Qxf3+ 27.Rg2 Qh3, threatening f4-f3, black gets a decisive attack.
25...Qxf3 26.Nd2 Bxg4!
Editor’s note:
According to MegaDatabase, this capture followed only after the players repeated the position once (26...Qe3 27.Nf1 Qf3 28.Nd2, and only then 28...Bxg4), but we’ll go along with Koblenz’s version. Concerning his exclamation mark for black’s last move, we can say that it was awarded for the pure playing value of Tal’s move, because it poses his opponent serious practical problems. However, from the objective point of view, the queen sacrifice is incorrect.
Black only gets a knight for the queen. However, the white king feels uncomfortable.
27.Nxf3 Bxf3 28.h4
(defending against the threat 28...
R
e5, 29...
N
g3+ and 30...
R
h5#)
28...Rf8 29.Be2
(white could resist more tenaciously with 29.b3).
Editor’s note:
The wording suggests that Koblenz thought that even after the strongest move 29.b3 white’s position would still be difficult. However, computer analysis shows that, with this move, white could get his a2 rook involved in defense and, with precise play, even convert his material advantage to a win. Nevertheless, the game move was the decisive mistake.
29...Ng3+ 30.Kh2 Bxg2 31.Kxg2 Nxe2 32.Qxe2 f3+ 33.Qxf3 Rxf3 34.Kxf3 Rf8+ 35.Kg3 Be5+ 36.Kg2 Bf4 White resigned.
The young player’s sharp combinational vision and his ability to find the most unexpected attacking resources started to garner respect. Even back then, Tal hated passive defense. And when he had to defend, he would use any opportunity to counterattack immediately.
If a young player has good defensive skills, this shows a true chess talent. Tal’s play confirms this rule of thumb.
No. 4
K. Klasups – M. Tal
1952, Riga, Latvian Championship
The young Tal’s tenacity and persistence in defense can be illustrated with numerous examples. Here’s a game from the 1952 Latvian Championship. Trying to prevent the freeing move f7-f6, white played
14.Qb3
There followed
14...f6!
Nevertheless! Black is trying to disrupt the blockade with any means possible. The idea of this counter-attack will become clearer several moves later.
15.Bxe6+ Kh8 16.Ne4
Editor’s note:
16.Na4, with the idea to drive the b6 bishop away or trade it, could give white an advantage. The game move, however, leads to a position where white has to struggle for equality.
16...fxe5 17.Kh1
Editor’s note:
The correct move was 17.f5, for instance, 17...Nf6 18.Nxf6 Bxe6 19.Qxe6 Qxe6 20.fxe6 Rxf6 21.Rxf6 gxf6 22.a4 Re8 23.a5 Bc7 24.e4 Rxe6 25.Be3 a6 26.Bc5 Bd6 27.Rd1 Bxc5+ 28.bxc5 Re7 29.Kf2, and, despite black’s extra pawn, the ending is drawn.
17...exf4 18.exf4 Nf6 19.Ng5 Ne4!
20.Nf7+
White accepts the challenge. After 20.Nxe4 Bxe6, the black bishops will seriously harass his opponent.
Editor’s note:
However, the capture on e4 was a much lesser evil than the game move, which simply loses.
20...Rxf7 21.Bxf7 Nf2+ 22.Kg1 Nd3+ 23.Kh1 Qe2 24.Bb2 Bh3!
How quickly the position has changed! Black’s counter-attack crushes his opponent.
25.Bxg7+
Desperation. After 25.gxh3, there was 25...Qe4+, winning.
25...Kxg7 26.Bd5 cxd5 27.Qxd5 Kh8 28.Qg5
28.gxh3 still didn’t work due to 28...Rg8.
28...Bd4 29.gxh3 Rg8 30.Rae1 Nxe1 White resigned.
And here’s what happened in the 1953 Latvian SSR championship semi-final:
No. 5
J. Mileika – M. Tal
1953, Riga, Latvian Championship
14...Qd7!
This move begins a well thought-out defensive plan. Black takes control over the f5 square. The natural 15.Rfe1 is met by 15...Nxg2 with a dangerous attack.
Editor’s note:
It seems that Koblenz was too optimistic here. Analysis shows that after 15.Rfe1 Nxg2? 16.Kxg2, black can’t create a real attack – for instance, 16...Qh3+ 17.Kg1 Ng4 18.Nf1 Qf3 19.Be3, and white repels all the threats and keeps the material. Perhaps Tal wouldn’t actually have sacrificed the knight and would have chosen some other move instead, accepting that his position is worse and needs protection. In any case, the immediate 14...b6 (Tal only played that on the next move) looks better – it attacks the c5 pawn that cramps black’s position and also intends a7-a5 and Bc8-a6, trading the opponent’s active bishop.
15.f3 b6! 16.cxb6
Editor’s note:
With this move, white loses all the advantage. The correct continuation was 16.Qc1! bxc5 (16...Ng6 17.Bxh6!, and if 17...gxh6 18.Qxh6 Qc6, then white has a pleasant choice between two winning moves: 19.Rae1 with the idea Re1-e5-g5, and 19.Bxg6 fxg6 20.Qxg6+ Kh8 21.Nh5) 17.Bxh6! with a big advantage (black can’t capture the bishop: 17...gxh6? 18.Qxh6 Ng6 19.Nf5! Ne8 20.Rfe1!+–).
16...axb6 17.Rfe1
Editor’s note:
Now the idea Qc2-c1 and Bd2xh6 doesn’t work: 17.Qc1 Ng6! 18.Bxh6 gxh6 19.Qxh6 Qd6!, and black holds (20.Rae1?? Qf4!–+; 20.Bxg6 fxg6 21.Qxg6+ Kh8, and white has nothing decisive, because the f6 knight isn’t pinned).
17...c5 18.Re5 c4 19.Bf5 Qa4 20.Qc1 Nxf5 21.Nxf5 Bxf5 22.Rxf5 Qd7!
Tal provokes his opponent to sacrifice an exchange. A bold decision, because this weakens the black king’s position.
Even back then, despite his youth, Tal was completely sure: to win, you should be ready to take risks.
23.Rxf6 gxf6 24.Bxh6 Rfe8 25.Qf4 Kh7 26.Qh4
26.Qxf6 was met with 26...Rg8 27.Qh4 Rg6! with counterplay. We should note that white could still draw with 26.Bf8! Rxf8 27.Qh4+ Kg6 28.Qg3+ etc.
26...Kg6!
We shouldn’t forget that the king can play an active role in defense as well!
27.g4
Editor’s note:
A mistake. White could still force a draw with the same idea of 27.Bf8 (there are also other equivalent resources) 27...Rxf8 28.Qg3+.
27...Rh8 28.Qh5+ Kh7 29.Kh1 Kg8 30.Rg1 Qe6
Editor’s note:
This decision could have cost Tal half a point. The correct move was 30...Re8!, and after 31.g5 f5 32.g6 f6 33.Qh4 Re6, black’s position is won.
31.g5 f5
A natural reaction. The attacking side is trying to open lines. Black, however, is trying to keep the position closed as much as possible.
32.g6 f6 33.g7
Editor’s note:
The immediate transfer of the queen to the h2-b8 diagonal could save white – 33.Qh4! Rxa2 34.Qf4! (threatening 35.Qb8+; 34.g7? Rh7 is a mistake that transposes into the actual game) 34...Re2 (after 34...Ra8? 35.h4, only black is at risk) 35.g7 Rh7 36.Qb8+ Qe8 37.Qd6! Rxh6 38.Qxd5+ Qe6 (38...Re6? 39.Re1) 39.Qa8+ Qe8 40.Qd5+ with perpetual check.
33...Rh7
(white’s attack fizzles out)
34.Qh4 Rxa2 35.Qg3 Re2 36.Ra1 Qe8 37.Qh4 Re6
, and
white resigned
after a few more moves.
The game below is a great example of the young Tal’s dynamic style.
No. 6, Sicilian Defense
M. Tal – M. Pasman
1953, Riga, Latvian Championship
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 6.f4
This active move was fashionable back then, but is now quite rare.
6...e5 7.Nf3 Nbd7 8.Bd3 Be7 9.0-0 0-0 10.Kh1 b5 11.a3 Qc7 12.fxe5 dxe5 13.Nh4
13...Nc5
Editor’s note:
In a modern grandmaster game J. Geller – B. Savchenko, Moscow 2011, black preferred 13...Nb6!?, covering the d5 square and intending to put the knight on c4 at some point.
14.Bg5
Until now, the game had followed theory. Tal played his first moves quickly – the opening studies paid off. White has an open f-file, his pieces are concentrated on the kingside, and the strategic plan is clear: attack the king’s position.
14...Qd8 15.Nf5 Bxf5 16.Rxf5 Nfd7 17.Bxe7 Qxe7 18.Nd5 Qd6 19.Qg4
Starting a multi-move combination with a sacrifice of two pieces. This game brilliantly shows the young player’s exceptional ability to create incredible combination complications. The difficulty of the combination lies in the fact that the following play isn’t forced: white methodically attacks while being two pieces down. One of Tal’s greatest strengths first manifested itself in this game. Even if his opponent gets counterplay, he rarely loses the initiative, finding more and more targets for attack. He attacks incessantly, creating one threat after the other.
19...g6
Editor’s note:
Black could defer this committal move for a while, choosing, for instance, 19...Rac8 instead, activating the rook.
20.Raf1 f6 21.h4
Editor’s note:
As we shall see, had black played correctly, such a sharp continuation could have come back to hit white like a boomerang. 21.R5f3 was a good move, with the idea of Qg4-h4.
21...Kh8 22.R5f3
Editor’s note:
The computer insists on 22.R5f2 f5 23.Qe2, going into passive defense, but Tal obviously didn’t play 21.h4 for that.
22...f5
White, of course, saw this counter-strike.
23.exf5! Qxd5
After 23...gxf5, white had 24.Bxf5 Qxd5 25.Bxh7!
Editor’s note:
The computer continues this line with a hard-to-find move 25...Qc4, and since 26.Qh5 loses to 26...Qxf1+ 27.Rxf1 Rxf1+ 28.Kh2 Nf6, white has to trade queens and go into an endgame materially down.
24.fxg6 Rxf3 25.g7+ Kg8 26.Bxh7+
The d3 bishop has been “revived” after great effort from white. However, to destroy the opposing king’s position, this bishop needs to be sacrificed.
26...Kxh7 27.Rxf3 Ne4!
Editor’s note:
27...Qe6! is even stronger, preventing white from pushing the h-pawn.
28.h5 Ndf6 29.Qg6+ Kg8 30.h6
White’s combination ends here. To save the game, black needs to play just one correct move
30...Ra7
The decisive mistake; it was hard for black to foresee all the consequences. He could have drawn with 30...Nh7! 31.Rf8+ Nxf8 32.gxf8=Q+ Kxf8 33.Qg7+ Ke8 34.h7 Qd1+ 35.Kh2 Qh5+ etc.
Editor’s note:
Actually, black’s position is won after 30...Ra7, and he had other good resources as well, such as 30...Rd8–+ or 30...Rc8–+.
31.Kh2!
This quiet move begins a hidden maneuver.
31...Re7
Editor’s note:
Only this move is the losing mistake. After 31...Qd2! black repelled the attack and won, because 32.Rh3 is refuted by 32...Qf4+ 33.g3 (33.Kg1 Ng5–+) 33...Qf2+ 34.Kh1 Ng5! 35.Qxg5 Rd7 36.Qc1 Rd2 with a mating counter-attack, while after 32.h7+ Nxh7 33.Qxe4 Qd6, black simply gets a decisive material advantage.
32.Rh3! Nh7 33.Rd3 Qa8 34.Qxe4!
That’s it! After the check on d8, white promotes a new queen and pushes the black king to the center of the board.
34...Qxe4 35.Rd8+ Kf7 36.g8=Q+ Kf6 37.Rd6+ Kf5 38.Qg6+ Kf4 39.g3+ Ke3 40.Rd3+ Qxd3 41.Qxd3+ Black resigned.
Leningrad, autumn 1953. The strongest of the strongest arrived for the national team championship. Once the Latvian team had sat down at their tables, the Lithuanian master I. Vistaneckis approached me.
“Listen, Koblenz, did you bring the republic’s first team or a schoolboy team? In the autumn, the boys should be studying, not traveling!”
Indeed, with the exception of I. Zhdanov and myself, all the players from Latvia were younger than 20!
And still, the decision of the Latvian Chess Federation to send young players to an important competition was correct. To become a strong chess player, you should face serious tests. The 1953 Soviet team championship turned out to be just such a test for many currently well-known players.
The dangerous-looking experiment turned out alright. The young Latvian players – Janis Klavins, Mark Pasman, Israel Zilber, Aivars Gipslis and Mikhail Tal (the latter two still looked like kids) – were at the center of attention. The “schoolboys” got ahead of many experienced opponents and qualified for the final.
The match against the Russian SFSR was the most exciting. The result of the 5-hour battle was sensational: Latvia won 5-4. There were some chances to take third place. The result of the adjourned game between candidate master Tal and international master G. Ilivitsky was very important (see diagram).
No. 7
M. Tal – G. Ilivitsky
1953, Leningrad, 3rd Soviet Team Championship
Here’s how the game ended.
46.Ke3! Rxg3+ 47.Kf4 Rg2 48.c4 Rc2
48...Kc5 was of course bad due to 49.g6+ and 50.Rg5.
Editor’s note:
Black could have drawn, for instance, with 48...e5+ 49.Kf5 (49.Ke4 Rg4+ 50.Kf5 Rxc4 51.g6 Rf4+ 52.Kg5 Ke7; 49.Ke3 Rg4) 49...Rf2+ 50.Kg6 e4; 48...Rg1 or 48...Rf2+ 49.Kg3 Rf1 was also enough.
49.g6 Ke7 50.c5 Kf6 51.Rg5!
The winning move.
51...e5+ 52.Ke4 Kg7
52...Kxg5 53.g7
53.Kd5 Black resigned.
Tal played second board in the competition and scored 4.5/7. For this success, the Highest Qualifying Commission decided to allow candidate master M. Tal to play a match for the master’s title.
The Leningrad competition made Tal more confident in his abilities. He prepared for that match very seriously. The first stage of preparation was the 1954 Latvian SSR championship. During the draw, Janis Klovans asked the other participants to uphold an old tradition. The fact of the matter was, that in the last three years the championship had been won each time by a first-year student of the Latvian University, and Klovans had just enrolled...
The tradition wasn’t broken. Klovans played brilliantly and won the Latvian championship. Tal had to settle for 2nd–3rd place.
In the summer, Tal played a qualifying match against the multiple champion of the Belorussian SSR, experienced master V. Saigin. There were 14 games in the match, and the Riga player won 8-6. For this victory, the young player was awarded the honored title “USSR Master of Sports”.
Game 8 was Tal’s best creative achievement in the match.
No. 8, Catalan Opening

1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.Nf3 e6 4.g3 cxd4 5.Nxd4 d5 6.Bg2 e5 7.Nf3 d4!
White can’t capture on e5 due to 8...Qa5+, and the advanced pawn disrupts communication lines between the flanks.
8.0-0 Nc6 9.e3 Be7 10.exd4 exd4 11.Nbd2
Editor’s note:
In modern times, the main line is 11.Bf4.
11...Be6 12.Re1 0-0 13.b3 Qd7 14.Bb2 Rad8 15.a3 a5 16.Ne5 Nxe5 17.Rxe5 b6 18.Nf3 Bc5
19.Qd2
After 19.b4, Tal intended to play 19...axb4 20.axb4 Bd6!, and the white rook has no good squares: 21.Re2 is met with 21...Bxc4, while after 21.Re1, there’s 21...Bxb4.
19...Ng4
After bolstering the center, black goes on the offensive.
20.Ree1 d3!
(opening the diagonal for the c5 bishop)
21.Rf1
After 21.Ne5, black intended to play 21...Nxe5 22.Rxe5 Bd4! After exchanging the bishops, his passed pawn will become dangerous.
21...Qd6!
This move should have been anticipated beforehand. Black parries two threats at the same time – 22.b3-b4 and 22.h2-h3. If now 22.h3, then 22...Nxf2! 23.Rxf2 Qxg3.
Editor’s note:
Koblenz’s line leads to unclear play after 24.Be5 Qg6 25.Kh2 Bxf2 26.Qxf2, so white should have gone for this position.
22.Qc3
Editor’s note:
This move is a serious mistake, because it allows black to create a strong initiative. 22.Bc3 keeps the position equal.
22...f6 23.Rad1
White couldn’t play 23.Ng5 due to 23...Nxf2! 24.Rxf2 Bxf2+ 25.Kxf2 fxg5+
Editor’s note:
White still had some defending chances after 23.Bc1!, intending Bd2 or Bf4.
23...Rfe8 24.Rd2 Bf5 25.Ng5
25...Ne3!
(the decisive blow)
26.fxe3
If the rook retreated, black traded the g2 bishop – an important kingside defender.
26...Bxe3+ 27.Kh1 Bxd2 28.Qxd2 Re2 29.Qc3 Rxg2! White resigned.
If the rook is captured, black wins by pushing the d-pawn – 30.Kxg2 d2 31.Rd1 Bg4 32.Nf3 Qd3!
However, Tal’s play wasn’t always so consistent. The desire to complicate the position and create conditions for some kind of combination once cost him an important point.
No. 9
M. Tal – V. Saigin
1954, Riga, Master Title Match, game 11
White had a simple win: 40.Nxh5 Rxh5 41.Bd6! Because of the h5 rook’s poor position and the decisive weakening of the kingside, black would just have to resign. Instead, Tal went for a complicated combination, but the spectacular finishing move turned out to be impossible!
40.Rd7 gxf4 41.Qd5+ Rae6 42.Qc5 Reg6 43.Rxc7
Editor’s note:
White could have forced a draw by repetition with 43.Qd5+ Re6 44.Qc5.
43...Rxg2+ 44.Kf1 Qd8!
Black threatens to turn the game around with 45...Be2+ 46.Kxe2 Rxf2+. Tal thought that after 45.Qf8+ Qxf8 46.Bxf8 Rhg6, he would force his opponent’s resignation with the elegant 47.Bg5! When he started the combination, he simply forgot that the bishop couldn’t move to g5 from f8!
The ending was miserable:
45.Qd5+ Qxd5 46.Rc8+ Kf7 47.Rc7+ Ke8
, and
white resigned.
Tal remembered this loss for a long while.
In this period, Tal’s number-one enemy was hasty decision-making, so characteristic of young players.
No. 10
M. Tal – J. Klovans
1954, Riga
Black is in zugzwang. After 22.g3
or 22.Re3 and Rf3 he should lose.
Editor’s note:
Actually, black is not in zugzwang just yet (right now, only the e7 bishop cannot move), but after the strongest 22.Nc6! (now all black pieces are tied down with the bishop’s defense), he gets very close to it and loses quickly: 22...h5 (after 22...Qd6 23.g4 Qf6 24.g5 Qd6 25.Re3 it is indeed zugzwang) 23.h4 Qd6 24.g3 Qf6 25.Re3 Qd6 26.Kg2 Qf6 27.Rf3 Qg7 28.Re6 f6 29.Ne5+–.
However, Tal, almost without thinking, played
22.Qc6?
After
22...Red8 23.Qe4 Bd6
(
Editor’s note:
23...Bxb4, winning a pawn, is even stronger – it’s now white who should struggle for a draw)
24.Re8+ Kg7 25.Rxd8 Rxd8 26.Nc6
, white still has an advantage, but he needed a much bigger effort to convert it than in the original position.
Editor’s note:
Koblenz’s evaluation looks too optimistic. The game continued
26...Rd7 27.c4
(best)
27...bxc4
(the immediate 27...Bf8! is even better)
28.Qxc4
, and instead of
28...Qf4
(after which white doesn’t have any advantage either, by the way), black could play 28...Bf8! with the idea of Rd7-d2, seizing the initiative as a result. The game ended in a
draw
after 50 moves.
Back then, Tal often played in blitz tournaments, which, of course, affected his game. Endless blitz games are one of the reasons for “automatic” rashness in important games. Tal occasionally couldn’t stand the intense struggle and tried to force events.
“Automatic play” is especially dangerous in better and won positions. Emanuel Lasker, the ex-world champion, would say, “A won position is the hardest to win.” The fact that Tal managed to overcome his impatience and nervousness in a relatively short time raised my hopes.
Filled with battle fervor, Tal, as the leader of the republic’s youth team, travelled to Leningrad for the USSR youth championship. He came second in individual scores (after B. Spassky).

Editor’s note:
This move is actually bad and could have led to a worse position for white.
21...cxd5 22.Qxd5+ Nf7 23.Qxa8 Bc6 24.Bb6!
The point of the combination. Tal left his queen deep behind enemy lines for a purpose!
24...axb6 25.Rc1 Bxa8
(black could resist better with 25...

Editor’s note:
Actually, after Koblenz’s move 25...Bf8, black is simply better. For instance: 26.Bb5 Bxa8 27.Rxc7 Ncd6 28.Bd3 g4!, seizing the initiative.
26.Rxc7 Rc6
Editor’s note:
Black shouldn’t have gone for the rook exchange, because after it, his counterplay chances are close to zero. 26...Ncd6 was much better, planning kingside activity after g5-g4 at some point.
27.Rc1 Rxc7 28.Rxc7 Ncd6 29.Nd2! Bf8 30.Bc4
, and
white won
, converting his advantage.
In autumn 1954, the Soviet team championship was held in Riga. In this competition, Tal played against a grandmaster for the very first time. He was pitted against Yuri Averbakh, the current Soviet champion, in the match Daugava – Zenit.
The game was very tense. Tal played white and sacrificed a pawn in the opening. His opponent found the correct defensive plan and seized the initiative. It seemed that Tal would definitely lose. However, Averbakh made a blunder in time trouble, and the position changed drastically. The grandmaster couldn’t make his 40th time-control move and lost on time in a roughly equal position.
Tal was, of course, glad that he had brought a valuable point to his team, but on the way home, he was downcast. This didn’t feel like a true victory. Trying to seize the initiative out of the opening with dubious gambit lines was an unreliable method, especially against grandmasters.
How should he play against grandmasters? This question bothered him a lot. And so, against Taimanov, Tal decided to play differently, “the grandmaster way” – quietly and methodically. This ended badly – Taimanov scored an easy win. It turned out that tactical inventiveness alone wasn’t enough, and in a positional game Tal was still much weaker than the top players.
His sporting results in this competition weren’t brilliant: 4/10, sharing next-to-last place on first board. However, his opponents were also much stronger than those he had faced before.
The game against international master Lev Aronin especially attracted my attention. Even though Tal lost, I think that the exceptional talent of the future grandmaster really shone through in this game.

Editor’s note:
These days, 6.d4 is by far the most popular move.

This move occurs rarely in current practice. Black plays 6...Bf5 more often.

Launching a combination with a rook and knight sacrifice.
Editor’s note:
This sacrifice is objectively dubious.

If 12...Kd8, then 13.Ng5! Bg6 (13...Bxd1 is met with 14.Nf7+ Kc8 15.Re8+) 14.Rxf6!
Editor’s note:
The correct move is 12...Be7 – after 13.Qe1 Nf8 14.Rxf6 Bxf3 (but not 14...0-0-0? 15.Bf4) 15.Rxf3 Ng6 16.Qe6 Rf8 17.Rxf8+ Nxf8 18.Qg4 Bf6 (there are other good moves as well), black is out of danger and at the very least no worse.
13.Ng5+ fxg5 14.Qxh5+ Kxe6 15.Bxg5 Ne5! 16.Re1 Qg7
17.Qg4+?
A pity! After the game, Tal showed that white could maintain the attack with 17.dxe5! For instance, 17...Rg8 (best) 18.Qg4+ Kf7 19.Qd7+ Kg6 20.Qe6+ Kxg5 21.Re4 with the threat 22.Rg4. If 21...Kh5, then 22.Qf5+ Qg5 23.Qxh7+ Bh6 24.Qf7+ and Qf3+.
Tal decided against the move because he thought it wasn’t enough to win. However, black now repels the attack.
Editor’s note:
After 17.dxe5, instead of Koblenz’s move 17...Rg8?!, black could have put up much stiffer resistance with 17...Be7 – even though the position after 18.Bf6! Qg6 19.Qf3 Rhd8 20.Qb3+ Rd5 21.Qxb7 Qe8 22.Bxe7 Rb8 23.Qxa7 Ra8 24.Qb7 Rb8 25.Qa6 Kxe7 26.e6, where white has five pawns for the rook, a dangerous passed e-pawn and an attack, is evaluated as lost for black by the computer, it’s still unclear for a human. However, instead of 17.dxe5, white had a good alternative 17.Rxe5+, and after 17...Kd7 (or 17...Kd6 18.Bf4 Kd7 19.Rg5 Qxd4 20.Qg4+ Ke8 21.Re5+ Be7 22.Qg7+–) 18.Qg4+ Kc7 19.Qg3 Kd7 (19...Kb6 20.Qb3+ Kc7 21.Rf5!+–) 20.Qb3 b5 (20...Kc7 21.Rf5!+–) 21.Qe6+ Kc7 22.Bf4 Qd7 (22...Kb7 23.d5!+–; 22...Kb6 23.c4! bxc4 24.a4+–) 23.Rd5+ Bd6 24.Qxd7+ Kxd7 25.Rxd6+ Kc7 26.Be5 Rhe8 27.Rh6+ Kb6 28.Rxh7 white obviously wins.
17...Kd6!
Aronin defends precisely. After 17...Kf7 18.Rxe5 Kg8 19.Qh4 white maintained dangerous threats.
Editor’s note:
Actually, black’s move is a mistake. 17...Kf7 was the correct move, even though after 18.dxe5!? (Koblenz’s line 18.Rxe5 Kg8 19.Qh4 leads to threefold repetition after 19...Qg6 20.Bf6 h6 21.Re3 Kh7 22.Rg3 Qf5 23.Rf3 Qg6) 18...Be7 19.Qf3+ Ke8 20.Bf6 Qf8 21.Bxh8 Qxh8 22.Qg4, white has the initiative, and his next plan involves activitating the rook along the third rank.
18.dxe5+
Editor’s note:
After 18.Rxe5! with threats 19.Qe6+/19.Qf4/19.Qg3/19.Rf5 white won.

Editor’s note:
The correct move was 25...Qe7. After the game move, however, white should have played 26.Qf6! with the subsequent e6-e7, f2-f4 and, according to the computer, he has enough compensation for a draw.
26.Qf5 Qe7
The attack has fizzled out, and
black won
, converting his material advantage.
Tal’s next tournament was the 1955 Latvian SSR championship.
“A tradition is a tradition” – a Latvian University freshman should win. That year, it was Aivars Gipslis. Tal finished second...
In the same year of 1955, Tal achieved his first serious success in All-Union competitions. In the Soviet championship quarter-final in Vilnius (the Baltic zone tournament), he shared 3rd–4th place and qualified for the semi-final.

Tal played his first games without much effort, and the results showed. By the middle of the tournament, his chances of qualifying for the semi-final were minimal. However, at this critical moment, the young master suddenly transformed. He treated every game with the utmost importance. Showing great composure and tenacity, he defeated some serious opponents and finished among the prize winners.
44...h3 45.Kg1 e4 46.a6!
White’s best counter-chance is to create a passed pawn. 46.fxe4+ Kg4 47.a6 was worse due to 47...f3 48.axb7 f2+ 49.Kf1 h2 50.Rg3+ Kh4!, and the h-pawn is unstoppable.
46...e3 47.axb7
The strongest reply was 47.Rc1, which black intended to meet with 47...Rxb3 48.axb7 Rxb7 49.c6 Rc7, winning.

(avoiding the rook exchange)
16.Rac1 Nh5 17.Ne4 Ne6 18.Nd6
It was hard to predict that after winning a pawn on the queenside, white would have to withstand an attacking storm on the opposite flank. It was better to double rooks on the d-file.
Editor’s note:
Actually, an attempt to double the rooks leads to a difficult position for white: 18.Rc2? (the moves with the other rook lose immediately: 18.Rd2?? f5 19.Nc3 e4 20.Nd4 f4 21.gxf4 Nexf4–+, 18.Rd3?? f5 19.Neg5 Nf8!–+, 18.Rd6?? f5–+) 18.Rc2? f5 19.Nc3 (19.Nd6? e4 20.Nh2 f4 with a strong and probably decisive attack) 19...Be8 (threatening 20...e4) 20.Rcd2 Rxd2 21.Bxd2 (21.Rxd2?? f4–+) 21...e4 22.Nh2 Rd8 with a great positional advantage.
18...b6 19.c5 Rab8 20.cxb6 axb6 21.Nc4 e4 22.Nfd2
Editor’s note:
22.Nd4 (threatening 23.Nxe6 Bxe6 24.Nxb6) was safer: after the trades on d4, the position is equal, and if 22...Nc7?!, then after 23.g4! c5 (23...Nf6 24.Bf4 with the initiative) 24.gxh5 cxd4 25.Bxd4 Bxd4 26.Rxd4 white is better.
22...b5 23.Na5 f5! 24.Nxc6 Bxc6 25.Rxc6 f4! 26.gxf4 Nexf4 27.Nf1 Qg5 28.Rxd8+ Rxd8
29.Bxf4
Editor’s note:
29.Ng3 could have saved the game — after the subsequent 29...Nxg3 30.Bxf4 (30.fxg3 Nxh3+ 31.Bxh3 Qxe3+ 32.Kg2 doesn’t lose either) 30...Nxe2+ 31.Qxe2 Qxf4 32.Qg4 Qxg4 33.hxg4, there’s a drawn endgame on the board.
29...Nxf4 30.Ng3 e3! 31.Rc2
31.fxe3 would’ve been met with 31...Nxg2 32.Kxg2 Qd5+
31...exf2+ 32.Kxf2
32.Qxf2 doesn’t help due to 32...Bd4 33.e3 Bxe3 34.Qxe3 Nxh3+.
32...Bd4+ 33.Kf1 Nh5! 34.Bf3
after 34.Nxh5, black wins with 34...Rf8+
34...Nxg3+ 35.Kg2 Ne4+ 36.Bg4 h5 37.e3 Bxe3 38.Qb4 Qe5 39.Qe1 Bd2 40.Qh4 g5
The time trouble ended, and further resistance was futile.
White resigned.
At the Soviet team championship in Lugansk I worked as Latvia’s coach. I arrived in the city at 3 in the morning, but Misha wasn’t in his room. I found him in the room where the Ukrainian players lived. A blitz tournament had just ended. It was easy to see by my facial expression that the coach wasn’t exactly thrilled by the exhausting night competition.
Tal was very lively. Holding a sheet of paper and a pencil in his hand, he asked with a smile, “Maestro, can I enroll you in the next blitz tournament?”
However, his opponents were already out of energy.
“Maybe it’s time to stop, Misha? The games are tomorrow, we should catch some sleep.”
I shared a room with Tal in Lugansk. Each day in the morning, and sometimes in the evening as well, other players from the team gathered in our room. The game analyses were endless.
Tal obviously looked tired, and I asked the hotel administrator to move him to a single room. But the young master didn’t even want to hear about that. He wanted to take part in the team work and help his friends. When team interests were at stake, he didn’t think about himself.
No. 15
I. Lipnitsky – M. Tal
1955, Lugansk, 4th Soviet Team Championship Semi-Final
Tal played on the second board and shared 1st–3rd place in the semi-final.
He saved the game against Isaak Lipnitsky with an exceptionally tenacious defense.
In his annotations to the game, Lipnitsky wrote, “The entire Ukrainian team analyzed the adjourned position. To win, we decided to send the white king to the kingside, towards the h-pawn, or prevent the black king from reaching the g6 square. For instance, 45...Kd5 46.Be3 Bb8 47.Bf4 Ba7 48.b8=Q Bxb8 49.Bxb8. If now 49...Ke6, then 50.Kf4 Kf6 51.Be5+ Kg6 52.Bb2, and the game is won. (
Editor’s note:
Instead of 49...Ke6, black should play 49...a3, and after 50.Kf4 Kc4 51.Be5 Kd3! 52.g4 Ke2 53.g5 a2 54.Kg4 Ke3 55.Kh5 Kf3 56.Kh6 Kg4 57.Bf6 Kf5, it’s a draw.)
45...Kd7!
The Latvian players also did great work! Now white can’t win a tempo with 46.Be3 Bb8 47.Bf4, because after 47...Bxf4 48.gxf4, the b7 pawn can’t be defended.
46.Bf4 a3 47.b8=Q Bxb8 48.Bxb8 Ke6 49.Kf4 Kf6
That’s the point behind the subtle move 45...Kd7! If the black pawn were on a4, white would win easily after 50.Bd6.
50.Be5+ Kg6 51.Ba1 a2 52.Bb2 h5 53.Ba1 Kh6
If 54.Kf5, then 54...h4! 55.gxh4 Kh5, with a draw. So, a
draw was agreed
.”
Tal’s best achievement in Lugansk was his win against the young Moscow champion, Evgeny Vasiukov.
In this game, white’s play was very precise and determined.

1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 g6 5.c4 Nf6 6.Nc3 Nxd4 7.Qxd4 d6 8.Be2 Bg7
9.0-0
Editor’s note:
In modern top-level games, white usually doesn’t hurry with castling: the current main line is 9.Be3 0-0 10.Qd2 Be6 11.Rc1 Qa5 12.f3 Rfc8 13.b3 a6 14.Na4 Qxd2+ 15.Kxd2.
9...0-0 10.Qd1
Editor’s note:
This decision to return the queen to the starting square didn’t find many followers among strong players. The most popular moves in subsequent grandmaster practice were 10.Qe3, 10.Qd3, and 10.Bg5.
10...Be6 11.Be3 Qa5
Both sides have completed their development. White controls the central squares and has some positional advantage. Black’s goal is to prepare a queenside attack.
12.Rc1 Rfc8 13.b3 a6 14.f4!
White needs to be energetic, otherwise black will be the first to launch an attack with b7-b5.
14...Ng4
Inventive, but leads to white’s advantage. It was better not to deviate from the marked out plan and play 14...b5.
Editor’s note:
Koblenz’s move 14...b5 is also a suboptimal decision because of the reply 15.f5!. After 15...Bd7 (perhaps 15...gxf5 16.exf5 Bd7 is the lesser evil, even though black’s position is still very suspect) 16.fxg6 hxg6 17.e5! dxe5 18.Rxf6 and 19.Qxd7 (which has happened several times in practice), white has a big advantage. However, 14...Bg4!? is worth considering, as played in the game Haznedaroglu – Malakhov, Tripoli 2004. There followed 15.Bxg4 Nxg4 16.Qxg4 Bxc3 with approximate equality.
15.Bd4 Ne3
Editor’s note:
Perhaps it was better to go for passive defense with 15...Nh6!?, intending to trade on d4 and then play f7-f6 and Nh6-f7.
16.Bxe3 Bxc3 17.f5 Bd7 18.c5 Rxc5
The exchange sacrifice was evidently forced. Black is assuming that the pawn and bishop pair are adequate compensation for the small material deficit. Actually, this is not true.
Editor’s note:
Black could play 18...Bb5, holding onto the material for a while, but after 19.Bxb5 axb5 20.Qd5, black’s position is difficult.
19.Bxc5 Qxc5+ 20.Kh1 Qa5 21.Bc4 Rf8 22.fxg6 hxg6 23.Qd5! b5
Editor’s note:
23...Bc6 still gave some chances to save the game.
24.Rxf7 bxc4 25.Rcf1! Rc8 26.Rf8+ Kh7 27.Qg8+ Kh6 28.Rxc8 Bxc8 29.Qxc8 cxb3 30.axb3 Bf6 31.Qf8+ Kh7 32.Qf7+ Kh6 33.Qd5! Qa2 34.Qd3 a5 35.Qc4
White improves his queen’s position and goes for the adjournment, hoping to find a precise path to the win during home analysis.
35...Kg7 36.g3 Qb2 37.Qd3 Qa2 38.Rc1 Qf2 39.Rf1 Qa2 40.Qf3 Qc2 41.Rf2
The game was adjourned here. In the resumption, there followed
41...Qb1+ 42.Kg2 Kf7 43.h4! Ke8 44.h5! g5 45.h6 Kf8 46.Qf5 Qxb3
(desperation)
47.Qc8+ Kf7 48.h7
, and
black resigned.
The semi-final of the 23rd Soviet championship was approaching. It was a very difficult exam. Playing in the final is every master’s dream, so the semi-finals are true battles to the death. After the draw, Tal thought about the tournament table for a long time: there were very experienced players with deep theoretical knowledge among the Riga semi-final participants. These included grandmaster Viktor Korchnoi, the winner of the Bucharest international tournament, grandmaster Isaak Boleslavsky, and international master Semyon Furman, one of our best theoreticians.
Tal achieved a good start – 4.5/7. Then he won 4 games in a row and joined the leaders’ group. Like in the Vilnius quarter-final, his play in the second half of the tournament was most inspired, and he finished first.
He had reached the final!
Here’s one of the games from the Riga semi-final.
No. 17, Sicilian Defense

Editor’s note:
This seems to be a bad move. In modern grandmaster practice, black usually plays 9...b5, 9...h6 or 9...Be7.
10.Nf3 Qa5
By leaving the king in the center, black hopes to organize a kingside attack. White prepares a central breakthrough.
11.Kb1!
Before the attack, white makes a necessary prophylactic move. Had he played 11.e5 immediately, black would have counterattacked with 11...Nb4 12.exf6 Rxc3 13.Nd4 Ra3!.
11...b5 12.Bxf6
Editor’s note:
As a number of subsequent games showed, the move 12.e5 poses a lot of problems for the opponent. Play usually continued 12...b4 (perhaps 12...Nd5 13.Nxd5 Qxd2 14.Rxd2 exd5 is the lesser evil, even though after 15.a4, black’s position is quite unpleasant) 13.exf6 bxc3 14.fxg7 Bxg7 15.Qxd6 with a big advantage.
12...gxf6 13.f5 Nb4 14.a3 Nc6 15.Nd4 Nxd4
An inaccuracy. Black should have played 15...b4. For instance, 16.Nxc6 Bxc6 17.axb4 Qxb4 18.Qd4 Rb8! 19.b3 a5 (
Editor’s note:
this move loses to 20.Qxf6, so the correct continuation is 19...Qxd4 20.Rxd4 a5=).
16.Qxd4 Be7 17.Be2 Kd8
White threatened 18.Bh5. Perhaps 17...0-0 was better, which could be met with 18.Rd3 Kh8 19.Rh3, with dangerous threats.
Furman hopes to find a shelter for his king in the center, but his position quickly deteriorates.
18.Rhf1 Rb8?
Tal intended to meet 18...Rg8 with 19.fxe6 fxe6 20.Rxf6 Rxg2 21.Rf7 Rxc3 22.Rxe7 Rc6 23.Rxh7 Rxe2 24.Rh8+! Be8 25.Qa7 (
Editor’s note:
25.Qf6+ wins immediately) 25...Qc7 26.Qa8+ Qc8 27.Rxd6+! Ke7 28.Rxe8+ Qxe8 29.Qxc6 Qxc6 30.Rxc6, and the rook ending is hopeless for black.
Tal demonstrated this difficult line right after the game.
19.fxe6 fxe6 20.Rxf6 b4
After 20...Bxf6, white had 21.Qxf6+ Kc7 22.e5! d5 23.Nxd5+ exd5 24.Qd6+ Kc8 25.Rxd5 Rb7 26.Rc5+ Rc7 27.b4!, winning easily.
21.Rf5 e5
An exceptionally complicated position. Three white pieces are en prise, but he still manages to obtain a decisive advantage.
22.Qa7 Qb6
After 22...Rc8, black could’ve been checkmated: 23.Nd5! bxa3 24.b4 Qa4 25.Qb6+ Ke8 26.Bh5#.
23.Qxb6+ Rxb6 24.Nd5 Bxf5 25.exf5!
The rest is simple:
25...Rb8 26.f6 Bf8 27.axb4 Kd7 28.g4 Rg8 29.h4 h6 30.Rg1 e4 31.g5 hxg5 32.hxg5 Ke6 33.Bc4 Ke5 34.g6 Bh6 35.Ne7 Rgd8 36.g7
, and
black resigned.
The years of hard work paid off.
Now it was time to think about preparing for games against the strongest grandmasters, coming up with the right strategy for a competition which would attract the attention of millions of chess fans.
The First Final
And so, we’re in Leningrad. The debutant of the 23rd Soviet chess championship is all excited. He can’t wait until the moment he’s finally able to play against the renowned grandmasters and masters.
Tal played at ease and quickly in this important competition. He never got into time trouble. While his opponents were calculating complicated lines, he walked around the stage, looking at the unfolding events in other games with interest.
Meanwhile, there was a lot of drama in his own games. Tal crossed the safety barrier far too often, and was close to losing on many occasions. For instance, Byvshev won two pawns against him, but overlooked his opponent’s disguised maneuver in time trouble, and the Riga player forced a perpetual check. In the first-round game against the Moscow master Vladimir Antoshin, Tal got into a difficult position. The young master even got a lot of flak over his wins against Vyacheslav Ragozin and Anatoly Bannik.
“An accidental success,” some pundits quickly said of Tal’s results.
However, we shouldn’t forget that, unlike pure analysis, chess struggle has many factors – psychological considerations, time trouble, a loss of concentration because of nervous strain, etc. The fact that Tal managed to use the smallest chances and maintain his composure in difficult and sometimes even hopeless positions only speaks in his favor.
Let’s remember that the young Botvinnik heard the same kind of criticism. For instance,
Shakhmaty v SSSR
wrote in 1936: “It’s hard to find a master who’d managed to save as many lost and even hopeless positions as Botvinnik.”
Tal’s game against Vladimir Simagin was very intense. White sacrificed a knight, then a rook. Simagin had to make thirteen moves with his king, with danger lurking everywhere.
At the end of the game, the Leningrad chess fans met Tal with an ovation. With their applause, they thanked the Riga master for the true aesthetic pleasure brought by this work of chess art.

1956, Leningrad, 23rd Soviet Championship, round 3
1.e4 c6 2.d4 d6
Entering the players’ room, the international master joked: “I lacked enough strength to push the pawn one square further.”
The move 2...d6 is, of course, entirely playable and was made by black to avoid the trodden paths.
3.Nc3 Nf6 4.f4! Qb6
Editor’s note:
Today, the most popular move by far is 4...Qa5.
5.Nf3 Bg4 6.Be2 Nbd7
Editor’s note:
In modern times, top players as a rule prefer 6...Bxf3 7.Bxf3 e5.
7.e5! Nd5 8.0-0 Nxc3 9.bxc3
9...e6
An error. It was necessary to eliminate the dangerous knight with 9...Bxf3.
10.Ng5! Bxe2 11.Qxe2 h6
(black provokes his opponent to sacrifice a knight)
12.Nxf7! Kxf7 13.f5 dxe5
Editor’s note:
13...Nxe5 is met with 14.Be3!+–
14.fxe6+
Editor’s note:
There was a more convincing line — 14.Qh5+ Ke7 15.fxe6 Kxe6 16.Be3 Qa5 17.dxe5 Nxe5 18.Qf5+ Kd6 19.Bf4+–.
14...Kxe6
15.Rb1!
Simagin didn’t expect this move. He calculated the line 15.Qg4+ Kd6, thinking he would be able to put up stiff resistance.
15...Qxb1 16.Qc4+ Kd6
Editor’s note:
16...Ke7 17.Ba3+ Kd8 18.Rxb1 Bxa3 19.Rxb7 Rc8 20.Rxa7 Bd6 was more tenacious
17.Ba3+ Kc7 18.Rxb1 Bxa3 19.Qb3! Be7
Black has enough material compensation for the queen, but his king is under attack.
20.Qxb7+ Kd6 21.dxe5+?
Tal thought for a long time back on his twelfth move, but then started playing very rapidly. The consequences of this dangerous approached showed quickly. Had Tal been more careful (or rather calmer), he would’ve noticed the simple line 21.Rd1! e4 22.d5! Ne5 23.dxc6+ Ke6 24.Qb3+ Kf5 25.Rf1+. After this mistake, white had to put a lot more effort into this attack.
21...Nxe5 22.Rd1+ Ke6 23.Qb3+ Kf5 24.Rf1+ Ke4
25.Re1+
Editor’s note:
The simplest way to victory was 25.Qe6!, threatening Re1+, for instance: 25...Bc5+ 26.Kh1 Rae8 27.Re1+ Be3 28.Qh3 Nc4 29.Qd7! Ne5 30.Qd4+ Kf5 31.Rxe3 h5 32.Qe4+ Kf6 33.Qf4+ and curtains.
25...Kf5 26.g4+ Kf6 27.Rf1+ Kg6 28.Qe6+ Kh7 29.Qxe5 Rhe8 30.Rf7 Bf8 31.Qf5+
Editor’s note:
31.Qd4 is much stronger (the queen stays in the center, maintaining the pressure on both flanks), intending h2-h4 and g4-g5. The point is that black won’t be able to either activate his bishop with Bf8-c5 or double rooks on the e-file (31...Re1+ 32.Kf2 Rae8?? 33.Rxf8+–).
31...Kg8 32.Kf2
An original idea! The king goes to help its major pieces. The simpler move was 32.Qg6 Re1+ 33.Kg2 Rae8 34.Rf1. (
Editor’s note:
After the subsequent 34...R1e2+ 35.Rf2 R2e5 36.Qxc6 Bc5, it would be quite difficult for white to win. However, 32.Qg6 was indeed preferable to the game move.)
32...Bc5+ 33.Kg3 Re3+ 34.Kh4
34...Rae8
After 34...Be7+, there was 35.g5! At first, instead of 35.g5, Tal wanted to play 35.Kh5 Rd8 36.Rxg7+, sacrificing the second rook. However, he then noticed that after 36...Kxg7 37.Qg6+ black could avoid defeat by putting his king on f8: 37...Kf8! 38.Qxh6+ Kf7 39.Qxe3 Rh8+
35.Rxg7+ Kxg7 36.Qxc5 R8e6
The last, decisive mistake. Later, grandmaster V. Ragozin showed that after 36...R8e7 37.Qxc6 Rf7, threatening 38...Rff3, black could still draw.
37.Qxa7+ Kg6 38.Qa8 Kf6 39.a4
(the passed pawn assures white’s victory)
39...Ke5 40.a5 Kd5 41.Qd8+ Ke4 42.a6 Kf3 43.a7 Re2 44.Qd3+ R6e3 45.Qxe3+
and
black resigned.
After a month of battles, Tal shared 5th–7th place, just one point behind the winners.
In summer 1956, Tal travelled to Sweden with the USSR team to take part in the students world team championship. In his first competition abroad, he scored 4/5.
Tal’s game against the Yugoslav grandmaster Borislav Ivkov made the rounds in the world chess press. “Tal! Remember the name!” wrote the
Jugoslovensik Sahovski Glasnik
magazine back then.
Soviet Champion
In late November 1956, the semi-final of the next, 24th Soviet championship, was played in Tbilisi. Tal played there again. Grandmasters Petrosian and Korchnoi, and masters Polugaevsky, Furman, Antoshin and others, competed for the right to take part in the main competition.
Tal’s start was disappointing. The first setback happened in the very first round. Analyzing his adjourned game against Kotkov, Tal found a subtle maneuver that should’ve won the game for him. However, during the play-off, he made a rash move that threw away all the hard-earned advantage, and the game ended in a draw.
Three more draws followed, and in the fifth round, Tal blundered and lost to master Vladlen Zurakhov. And then another three draws.
In round 9, Tal managed to outplay the “king of endgame studies”, international master Genrikh Kasparyan, in a difficult endgame. It looked like a turning point. However, he then suffered a new blow. In the game against Alexander Buslaev, Tal went for a spectacular mate in an overwhelming position, blundered and lost.
Indeed, Tal’s play was far from perfect at the start. Miscalculations in the middlegame and bad advantage conversion technique were the main causes for concern. His physical form was also far from perfect.
But all these failures didn’t break Tal, and in the second half of the tournament, he started to win one game after another. The turning point was round 13, when Tal played Yakov Yukhtman.
Yukhtman, who usually plays rather quickly, spent more than an hour on his 17th move. Indeed, there was a lot to think about!
No. 19
M. Tal – Y. Yukhtman
1956, Tbilisi, 24th Soviet Championship Semi-Final, round 13
Black is hoping to get things going on the kingside, but Tal’s unexpected tactical blow showed that he had other trouble coming.
17.Bd5!
Editor’s note:
Perhaps 17.Nd5! was even stronger.
17.Bd5! Nxe5
After 17...exd5, white, of course, would have played 18.exd6
18.Nxe5 exd5
It was necessary to eliminate the bishop, but now new weaknesses emerge in black’s position.
Editor’s note:
18...dxe5 19.Qxe5 0-0 20.Bxc6 bxc6 21.Rd7 Rfe8 was the lesser evil.
19.Nxd5 Bxd5 20.Rxd5 dxe5
If 20...0-0, then 21.Nd7 Rfe8 22.Qxe7! (22...Rxe7 23.Nf6+)
21.Rxe5 0-0 22.Rxe7
The rest is simple.
Editor’s note:
If we study the final part of the game more closely, it turns out that black still had good chances of saving the game.
22...Rac8 23.Qe4 b5 24.Re1 Rcd8 25.c4! bxc4 26.Qxc4 Qg6 27.Ra7 Rfe8 28.Rxe8+ Rxe8 29.g3 Re6 30.Kg2 Rf6 31.Ra8+ Kh7 32.Rd8!
32...Rxf2+
Walking straight into a trap. After widescale simplifications, white gets a won pawn endgame.
33.Kxf2 Qf6+ 34.Ke3 Qxd8 35.Qd3+! Qxd3+ 36.Kxd3 Kg6 37.Ke4 Kf6 38.g4 Ke6 39.b4 h5 40.gxh5 f5+ 41.Kd4 Kf6 42.a4 g4 43.b5 Black resigned.
Losing just half a point in the last four rounds, Tal shared 5th–6th place and again earned the right to play among the strongest in the 24th Soviet championship final.
Before I start the story about the 24th Soviet championship, I’d like to say a few words about the so-called psychological method of struggle.
It’s no secret that the individual approach to opponents – i.e. studying the particular features of their playing style, creative tastes and inclinations, and using that knowledge in games – has brought Tal many valuable points. The main feature of this method, which is not exactly new in chess, is the ability to impose unfamiliar, unpleasant playing conditions on the opponent. For instance, an opening they don’t like to play or a position that doesn’t meet their tastes and chess temperament.
“War is war!” Let the opponent struggle against the unfamiliar conditions!
In the first round of the 24th Soviet championship, Tal was due to play the Leningrad master Lev Aronson. After studying his games, we figured out that the Leningrad player preferred quiet maneuvering and tended to simplify the position. And so we decided to play for complications.
No. 20, Dutch Defense
L. Aronson – M. Tal
1957, Moscow, 24th Soviet Championship Final, round 1
1.d4 e6 2.c4 f5 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 Be7 5.g3 0-0 6.Bg2 d6 7.0-0 Qe8
8.Re1
Editor’s note:
An important alternative is 8.b3, intending to develop the bishop to a3 after Qe8-g6 or Qe8-h5, seriously hindering the standard pawn push e6-e5.
8...Qg6 9.e4 fxe4 10.Nxe4 Nxe4 11.Rxe4 Nc6
Avoiding the trap 11...Qxe4? 12.Nh4!
12.Qe2 Bf6 13.Bd2 e5 14.dxe5 dxe5
Of course, Tal could just capture on e5 with his knight. That was more solid, but after 14...Nxe5 15.Bc3, the game would have quickly ended in a draw.
Editor’s note:
14...Nxe5 is now usually met with 15.Nxe5 (instead of Koblenz’s 15.Bc3) 15...Bxe5 16.Bc3!? Bxc3 17.bxc3 – practice shows that, despite his compromised pawn structure, white has a small advantage because of his more active pieces and pressure along the long light-squared diagonal.
Black’s last move is risky – the e5 pawn can become weak. However, black’s 14th move was the turning point of the game. The weakness of the e5 pawn is rather relative. The main factor is that Tal managed to complicate the game, which probably didn’t feature in his opponent’s plans.
Now Aronson thinks he’s obliged to play for a win.
15.Bc3 Bf5 16.Nh4 Bxh4 17.Rxh4 Rae8 18.Qe3 h6 19.b4 Qf6 20.b5 Nd8 21.Bd5+
The beginning of an erroneous plan. Had Aronson kept his cool, he would have no doubt found the prosaic move 21.c5 with the subsequent 22.Ra4.
21...Kh8
This is stronger than 21...Kh7 22.Be4, with simplifications that are advantageous for white.
Editor’s note:
Instead of the simplifying 22.Be4, white had a more unpleasant move 22.Re1, increasing the pressure on the e5 pawn. If now 22...g5, then 23.Re4! Bxe4 24.Qxe4+ Kg7 (after 24...Qg6 25.Qe3 black’s position is even harder) 25.Bxe5 Rxe5 26.Qxe5, with an extra pawn in the endgame.
22.f4?
White thinks that the position is already ripe to play for a win. 22.c5 was best. After 22...c6, there was a complicated position with mutual chances.
Editor’s note:
After a long think, the computer prefers the move 22.Re1 with the main line 22...g5 23.Re4 Bxe4 24.Bxe4 b6 25.Bg2 Nf7 26.Bd5 — it thinks that white’s compensation (the bishop pair and pressure on the e5 pawn) is more than adequate. Another good alternative is 22.Rd1 – for instance, 22...c6 23.Bg2 g5 24.Rhd4! exd4 25.Bxd4 Rxe3 26.Bxf6+ Rxf6 27.Rxd8+ Kg7 28.fxe3 with an extra pawn in the endgame. But even after Koblenz’s 22.c5 c6, white is still somewhat better after the subsequent 23.bxc6 Nxc6 (or 23...bxc6 24.Bg2) 24.f4 because of the two bishops.
22...exf4 23.Qd2
Editor’s note:
After 23.Bxf6 fxe3 24.Rxh6+ Bh7 25.Bc3 c6 26.bxc6 bxc6 27.Bg2 the position is dynamically equal – white’s bishop pair is compensated by black’s active rooks and the passed e3 pawn.
23...Qb6+
With this unexpected check, Tal makes the white bishop lose control over the e1 square, which will be important later. The initiative is in black’s hands already!
24.Bd4
Editor’s note:
24.Qd4 is more solid, with a roughly equal position – for instance, after 24...Qg6 25.Qxf4 (threatening to capture on h6) 25...Kh7 26.Bb4 Rf6 27.Bc3 Rff8 28.Bb4 Rf6, the game ends in a threefold repetition.
24...Qg6 25.Qxf4 Kh7 26.Qxc7
Editor’s note:
This is an error – the queen gets too far away from the king. 26.Qd2 was the correct move.
26...Bb1!
(isolating the opponent’s rook)
27.Be5
Editor’s note:
White still had some chances after 27.Rf4 Re1+ 28.Kf2 Rfe8 29.Qxg7+ Qxg7 30.Bxg7 Kxg7 31.Bf3 – black has a piece for two pawns, but it’s not easy to get out of the pin along the first rank.
27...Ne6! 28.Qd6 Qf5 29.Bf4 Ng5
29...g5 was also possible, but Tal decided not to weaken his king’s position in time trouble.
30.Qb4 Be4 31.Bxe4 Rxe4 32.Rf1 Re2 33.Qd6
33...Rxa2!
Of course, 33...Nh3+? was bad due to 34.Rxh3 Qxh3 35.Qd3+.
34.Qd5 Qc2 35.c5 Rd8! 36.Bd6 Re8 White resigned
, as the threat 37...
R
e1 cannot be stopped.
Tal’s victory over Taimanov in the second round wasn’t convincing. The Leningrad grandmaster got an undeniable advantage in the opening. Tal only won because of a simple tactical blow overlooked by his opponent.
In the next round, Tal faced David Bronstein, whose games he’d always admired. He couldn’t wait for the game to begin.
No. 21, Grunfeld Defense
M. Tal – D. Bronstein
1957, Moscow, 24th Soviet Championship Final, round 3
1.d4 c6 2.c4 Nf6 3.Nc3 d5 4.Nf3 g6 5.cxd5
The strongest move; after 5...cxd5, black has no c-pawn anymore and so can’t bring his dark-squared bishop to life with c6-c5. Bronstein, of course, knew that white would be better, and acted out of psychological considerations: the game would be simplified, and his opponent would lose the opportunity to go for tactical complications which he normally pursued.
So, Bronstein thought that the subsequent position would not be to Tal’s taste.
5...cxd5 6.Bf4 Nc6 7.e3 Bg7 8.Be2 0-0 9.0-0
9.h3, preventing the trade of the dark-squared bishop, was worth considering.
Editor’s note:
Koblenz’s proposed move 9.h3, which provides the h2 square for the dark-squared bishop and prevents Bg4, leads to one of the main positions in this line. Even more often, white plays h2-h3 a move earlier and then develops the f1 bishop to e2 (like in this game) or d3 (which leads to another main position).
9...Nh5 10.Be5
Editor’s note:
10.Bg5 h6 11.Bh4 g5 12.Nd2!?, as played in Ruzele – Mozeris (Plateliai 2001) and Ernst – Appel (Germany BL 2014), was perhaps even more promising.
10...f6 11.Bg3 Nxg3 12.hxg3 Be6 13.Qb3!
White has to play actively, otherwise black will seize the initiative with Bf7 and e7-e5.
13...Na5 14.Qb4 Bf7 15.Rfd1
This prophylactic move is necessary. Black can’t play 15...e5 now due to 16.dxe5 fxe5 17.Nxd5! Bxd5 18.e4.
15...e6 16.e4! Rb8 17.Qa3 b5
The grandmaster spent 40 minutes thinking on this move!
18.b4 Nc4 19.Qxa7
When white grabbed the a7 pawn, Bronstein shook his head in surprise: if a grandmaster offers a sacrifice after a long think, he has obviously calculated everything very well. But Tal wasn’t inclined to believe anybody at face value!
19...Be8
Editor’s note:
The game move doesn’t give black enough compensation for the pawn; meanwhile, after 19...Ra8 20.Qc5 (20.Qb7?? Nd6 21.Qc6 Rc8–+) 20...Rc8 21.Qxb5 Nb2 22.Rdc1 Bh6 23.exd5 Bxc1 24.Rxc1 exd5, there was a complicated position evaluated as equal by the computer. 19...Re8!? was also interesting, with the ideas of Re8-e7 and Bg7-f8.
20.Bxc4 Rf7
Following the game, Tal said that after 20...Ra8 21.Qc5 Rc8, he was going to sacrifice the queen with 22.Bb3!? (
Editor’s note:
22.Bxd5! Rxc5 23.Bxe6+ Kh8 24.dxc5+– is much stronger), while if 21...Rf7, he intended to play 22.exd5!
21.Qa3
Tal breathed a sigh of relief: the white queen has come back home.
21...bxc4 22.exd5 exd5 23.Qb2 g5!
There are new unexpected threats: black is getting ready to launch a kingside attack with 24...g4 and f6-f5-f4.
24.Qd2! Rxb4
Now the above plan would not work, because after 24...g4 25.Ne1 f5, white would play 26.Ne2. (
Editor’s note:
Black has an unpleasant reply 26...Ba4, and the bishop makes itself useful, blocking the a2 passed pawn. 26.Nc2 was stronger, intending a2-a4 – the move 26...Qd6 with the ideas f5-f4 and Bg7-h6 is not dangerous for white because of 27.Qf4.)
25.Nxd5 Rb8 26.Ne3 Rc8 27.Rac1 Rfc7 28.Rc3 Bg6 29.Rdc1 Bf7 30.d5 Bf8 31.a3 Bc5 32.Rxc4
The technical stage of the game begins – white converts his material advantage.

41...Qxf2.
If 41...Qe5, then 42.Qc4! or 41...Qb4 42.Qf3!
42.Nf5 h4 43.Nxf8 hxg3+ 44.Kh3 Qg1 45.Kxg3 Kxf8 46.Qe7+ Black resigned.
The games against Keres and Petrosian were played in an impeccable positional style by Tal – he beat the grandmasters with their own weapon.
The game Keres – Tal was played in round 16, when the tournament atmosphere was very heated. Keres led the tournament with 10 points. Tal, Bronstein and Tolush were half a point behind.

Editor’s note:
A rare continuation. The main line is 8.Bd3.

Editor’s note:
In the game Mamedyarov – Adams (Bilbao 2013), black instead played 8...b6 9.Bd3 dxc4 10.Bxc4 Ba6 11.Bxa6 Nxa6 12.Rc1 Nc7 13.0-0 Ncd5 14.Nxd5 Nxd5 15.Bg3 Qd7 16.Ne5 Qb7, and the game soon ended in a draw without any problems for black.
9.Rc1
Editor’s note:
After 9.c5?! Ne4 10.Qc2 g5 11.Be3 f5 12.h3 Bf6, black had the initiative (Grigoryan – Fridman, Kallithea 2008).
9...Ne4 10.Bd3 Nxc3 11.Rxc3 dxc4 12.Rxc4
After 12.Bxc4 Bf6 13.Rd3 Qb6 black is in no trouble.
12...Qa5+ 13.Bd2
Keres is still playing quite quietly. However, this does not mean that he’s playing for a draw. In that case, he would’ve played 13.Qd2, offering to exchange queens.
13...Qd5 14.Qc2 f5!
Black bolsters his queen’s position in the center, not fearing potentially weakening the e-pawn.
15.0-0 Bd7 16.Rd1
Editor’s note:
In the game Mishuchkov – Sakaev (St. Petersburg 1997) there followed 16.Rc1 Rac8=.
16...Rac8
Winning the d4 pawn would have cost black too much: 16...b5 17.Rc3 Nxd4 18.Nxd4 Qxd4 19.Be3 Qf6 20.Bxf5!
Editor’s note:
Actually, Koblenz’s line is not dangerous for black: after the subsequent 20...Qxf5 21.Rxd7 Rad8 22.Qxf5 exf5 23.Rcc7 Bf6, there’s a drawn endgame on the board. However, instead of 19.Be3?, white has a much stronger move 19.Be2! – despite the lack of a pawn, white has a big advantage because of the great positioning of his major pieces and active bishops.
17.Be3 Na5! 18.Rxc8 Rxc8 19.Qe2 Bd6 20.Ne5
A pointless sacrifice. (
Editor’s note:
Koblenz probably meant that Keres was already intending to transition to an opposite-colored bishop endgame, giving up a pawn in the process.) After 20.Rc1 Rxc1+ 21.Bxc1, white was not under any threat.
20...Ba4 21.Re1 Bxe5 22.dxe5 Rd8 23.b4
Editor’s note:
The resulting endgame turned out to be very difficult for white. He had to play 23.Bc2 Bxc2 24.Qxc2
After 24...Qxe5 25.f4 Qb8 26.Bd2 Nc6 27.Qc4 Nd4 28.Be3 Qd6 29.Bxd4 Qxd4+ 30.Qxd4 Rxd4 31.Rxe6, there’s a rook ending that he can easily hold – 31...Kf7 (31...Rxf4 32.Re7=) 32.Re5 Kf6 (32...Rxf4 33.Rc5=) 33.g3 with a draw.
Instead of 24...Qxe5, black had a stronger continuation 24...Nc6 25.f4 a6 with a positional advantage, but white still had more chances to hold than in the actual game.
23...Bc6! 24.f3 Qxd3 25.Qxd3 Rxd3 26.bxa5 Rxa3 27.Bxa7 Rxa5
Black is a pawn up, but this advantage is quite difficult to convert because of the opposite-colored bishops.
28.Bd4 Ra2 29.Rb1 Rd2 30.Bc3 Rc2 31.Bd4 Kf7 32.h4
A new weakness. However, 32.h3 wasn’t much better.
32...Kg6 33.Rb4 h6!
White is in time trouble, and Tal provokes his opponent’s next moves, so that after 37.Bf8 the black pawns are vulnerable.
34.Rb2 Rxb2 35.Bxb2 Kh5 36.Ba3 Kxh4! 37.Bf8 Kg3 38.Bxg7 h5 39.Bh6 Bxf3!
An elegant bishop sacrifice that quickly decides the game.
40.gxf3 Kxf3 41.Kf1 b5 42.Bd2 h4 43.Bb4 h3 44.Kg1 Ke2 White resigned.

From the point of view of modern theory, the main moves here are 7...0-0 and 7...Qc7.

In subsequent tournament practice, this move has occurred only rarely at grandmaster level. The main line is 9.Qf4.
9...cxd4 10.Nf3 Nc6 11.g4 Nfe7 12.gxh5
Editor’s note:
12.cxd4 has also occurred, after which 12...Qa5+ looks good, for instance, 13.Bd2 Qa4 14.c3 b6 15.Ng5 Ba6, and black has no complaints (Lettieri – Navaratham, Paracin 2019). Another possible continuation is 12...Qc7 13.Bd2 Bd7 (intending 0-0-0 and f7-f6) with mutual chances (Dorawa – Uhlmann, Schkopau 1958 and O. Jacobsen – Bagirov, Helsinki 1961).
12...Qc7 13.Bf4 Ng6 14.Qg4 Nxf4
A serious mistake. Black should have played 14...Ngxe5 15.Nxe5 Nxe5 16.Qxg7 Nf3+ 17.Kf1 Qxf4 18.Qxh8+ Ke7 with a sharp, hard-to-evaluate position.
Editor’s note:
Actually, the game move is not bad at all.
15.Qxf4 dxc3
16.Qg5!
Editor’s note:
16.Rg1!? is worth considering; black would meet it with 16...f6 or 16...f5 with unclear play.
16...Qe7 17.Qxg7 Qf8
Editor’s note:
17...Rxh5!? looks interesting, as played in a correspondence game Hugentobler – Dambrauskas, ICCF 1999. There followed 18.Rg1 Qf8 19.Qf6 Rh6 20.Qf4 Bd7 21.Ng5 0-0-0 22.Nxf7 Nxe5 23.Qxe5 Qxf7 24.Qxc3+ Kb8, and black is no worse.
18.Qg5 Qh6
The white queen cannot be allowed to occupy such a strong position.
Editor’s note:
18...Rh6 was a stronger move, with the threat 19...Qh8. For instance, 19.Rg1 Qh8 20.Qg8+ Qxg8 21.Rxg8+ Ke7 22.Rg5 Bd7 with roughly equal chances.
19.Rg1 Qxg5
19...Qxh5 would have been met with 20.Qf6!
20.Rxg5 Bd7
Editor’s note:
Black should have first played 20...Ke7. Now, white could put his opponent in a very precarious situation after 21.h6!
21.Ke2 Ke7 22.Ke3 Raf8 23.Rag1 Be8
24.Nd4 f5
Black could’ve put up better resistance after 24...f6.
Editor’s note:
Actually, the game move is the decisive mistake, whereas after Koblenz’s move 24...f6, black doesn’t just “put up better resistance” – he shouldn’t lose at all, for instance: 25.Rg7+ Bf7 26.Nxc6+ bxc6 27.f4 Rxh5 28.Bg6 Rh3+ (28...Rxh2?? 29.Rb1+–) 29.Kd4 Rh4 30.Ke3 Rh3+ with threefold repetition.
25.Nxc6+ Bxc6
Editor’s note:
Black can’t hold after 25...bxc6 either: 26.Rb1! Rfg8 (any capture on h5 (26...Bxh5) loses to 27.Rb7+ with the subsequent 28.Rgg7) 27.Rxg8 Rxg8 28.Kd4, then getting the king to d6 after Rb1-b7+.
26.Kd4 f4 27.Rg7+ Rf7 28.Rg8 Rxg8 29.Rxg8 Rf8 30.Rxf8 Kxf8 31.h6 b6 32.Kxc3 Kg8 33.Bg6 a5 34.Kd4 Kf8 35.c3 Kg8 36.h7+ Kg7 37.Bf7 Bd7 38.Bg8
Black’s position is hopeless, and the
grandmaster resigned
on move 51.
The sixth-round game was truly breathtaking.
This is a position from the game Nezhmetdinov – Tal. At that moment, Tal led the tournament.
No. 24
R. Nezhmetdinov – M. Tal
1957, Moscow, 24th Soviet Championship Final, round 6
13...Ncxe5
This leads to great complications. It was impossible to fully calculate the numerous lines. Tal saw that after 13...Nxc5 14.Bd3 Ne4! 15.Qe1 Bb7 white couldn’t capture the pawn due to 16.Bxe4 dxe4 17.Qxe4 Ne7, and black is better. However, instead of 16.Bxe4, white could’ve played 16.Bb2, and Tal didn’t see how to improve black’s position after that.
Editor’s note:
After 16.Bb2, black could get a comfortable position, for instance, with 16...a5, intending Bb7-a6
13...Ncxe5
Tal created a pawn center, hoping to make it dynamic afterwards.
14.Nxe5 Nxe5 15.Qd4 f6 16.f4 Nc6 17.Qe3 Rd8 18.Rad1 e5
Editor’s note:
This active move leads to big trouble. Black should’ve made some waiting, neutral move, such as 18...Rb8.
19.fxe5 fxe5
Tal executed his strategic idea: he has created a dynamic pawn center. However, the continuation shows that it didn’t bring black anything good.
20.Bb5! Bb7
After 20...d4 21.Bc4+ Kh8 22.Qg5! white had an attack.
Editor’s note:
Instead of 21.Bc4+, white had an even stronger continuation: 21.Qe4 Bb7 (21...dxc3 22.Qxc6+–) 22.Bd3 g6 23.Bc4+ Kh8 24.Rf7 Rd7 25.Rdf1 dxc3 26.Qh4+–, so black shouldn’t have played 20...d4 in any case.
21.Qg3!
Editor’s note:
This move is actually not so good, because black could now play 21...Qe7!, getting good chances to hold the position after 22.Bxc6 Qxc5+ 23.Rf2 Qxc6 24.Qxe5 Qd7 (the pawn sacrifice 24...d4!?, activating the pieces, also deserves consideration). So, a stronger move was 21.Qg5 with a big advantage (in this case, 21...Qe7 doesn’t work due to the obvious 22.Qxe7 Nxe7 23.Bxe5+–).
21...Rd7
22.Rf2!
A strong move. White uses the f-file to his advantage. Also, the aggressive push of the d-pawn is now impossible. For instance, 22...d4 23.Bc4+ Kh8 24.Rdf1!, with pressure along the f-file.
22...Re8 23.h3 Ba8
23...d4 still doesn’t work due to 24.Bc4+.
24.Ba4 Bb7 25.Kh1 Ba8 26.Rf5
White goes for an all-out offensive.
26...e4
There was no defense against the threat of 27.Bxc6 and Rxe5.
27.Qxc7 Rxc7 28.Rfxd5 e3 29.Rd7 e2 30.Bb3+ Re6 31.Bxe6+ Kf8 32.Bxg7+ Black resigned.
The game with Nezhmetdinov further convinced Tal that chess principles have only a relative value. Why did black’s plan to create a strong center end in failure? Here’s how Tal himself explained the reason for his loss:
“The evaluation of any position is like scales. One of the heaviest weights, a dynamic pawn center, in this case ended up being lighter than the open f-file and the coordination between two white bishops and the queen.”
This comparison helps to reveal the essence of Tal’s creative method: he often allows his opponent to get a tangible positional advantage, but doesn’t forget about his own “weights” either, always achieving some kind of trade-off. In the Nezhmetdinov game, Tal’s “weight” was too light. Well, that happens.
I must admit that, the next day, I was somewhat worried: how would the loss affect my ward? But as soon as I saw Tal, my anxiety was gone. He was cheerful and happy, because his loss was deserved!
We discussed how to play against Antoshin and then went for a walk.
“Time goes so slowly,” Tal said nervously. “I already want to start the game!”
In this game, Tal’s play was very dynamic. Everything seemed to go well, but then the Riga master made an inexplicable mistake.
Here’s the game.

Theory prefers 11...Rb8.
Editor’s note:
The move 11...Rb8 counters dxe5 with the subsequent Bxb6 – now black can simply take on b6 with the rook, avoiding doubled pawns. Also, in such positions white often tries to play a2-a4, which may lead to the opening of the b-file, and the rook on b8 may be useful in this case as well.
12.cxd4 d5 13.Nc3 dxe4 14.Nxe4 Bf5 15.d5 Na5
A serious mistake. With 15...Bxe4 16.Bxb6 Bxf3 17.Qxf3 Ne5!, black could still resist. (
Editor’s note:
After the subsequent 18.Rxe5 cxb6, the position is almost completely drawn: there are opposite-colored bishops on the board, white has no attacking chances, and his passed pawn can’t move further.)
16.d6 cxd6
If 16...Bxd6, then, of course, 17.Bxb6. After 16...Bxe4, there’s 17.dxe7 Qxe7 18.Bxb6 cxb6 19.Nd2, winning a piece.
17.Bxb6 Qxb6 18.Ng3 Be6 19.Bxe6 fxe6 20.Rxe6 Bf6

25...Nxb2 26.Qd5+ Kh8 27.Qd4 Rxd7 28.Qxd7 Rg8 29.Ng5 h6 30.Nf7+ Kh7
There were, as always, lots of masters and journalists in the press center. The door suddenly opened, grandmaster Geller briskly walked in, and said, “Tal has a beautiful forced win!”
And he quickly showed the line: 31.Qf5+ g6 32.Qd7 gxh5 33.Ng5+ Kg6 34.Qe6+ Kxg5 35.g3, and black has to resign, because after 35...h4, he gets checkmated: 36.f4+ Kh5 37.Qf5+ Rg5 38.g4#.
“A spectacular finish! Let’s go to the hall, there’ll probably be applause,” said master Evgeny Zagoryansky, the press center administrator.
We went to the box seats; several grandmasters and journalists were already there.
Time went by, however, and Tal still continued to think, leaning close to the board. Almost quarter of an hour passed.
“Why is Tal thinking for so long, doesn’t he see the win?” Salomon Flohr asked.
“He doesn’t,” Igor Bondarevsky replied.
“You really think that Tal doesn’t see it?” grandmaster Andor Lilienthal argued.
However, Tal was still feverishly calculating the lines, and his opponent walked about the stage, feigning indifference. The minutes seemed endless to me. Finally, there was a flurry of whispers in the hall: the spectators also noticed the winning line.
Almost an hour passed. Finally, Tal raised his hand to make a move, and the whole hall held their breaths.
But what happened? There was no applause. The spectators groaned in disappointment.
31.h4?
How could Tal miss a simple mating combination?
“I saw it, but I thought that it wouldn’t work,” Tal explained afterwards. “I thought that the pawn was on g2, rather than g3, and so, g2-g4 was not a checkmate, because the opponent had 38...hxg3.”
In the actual game, there followed:
31...Qc8! 32.Nf6+ Kg6 33.Nxg8 Qxd7 34.Ne5+ Kh7 35.Nxd7 Kxg8 36.Nc5 a5 37.Kf1 Nd1 38.Ne4 b4 39.Ke2 Nb2 40.Kd2 a4
, and a
draw was agreed.
I tried to console Tal, to take his mind off that game, but all my efforts were in vain: he was depressed, even though this setback didn’t hurt his standings in the tournament – he still led after that draw. But the young master wasn’t thinking about the lost half-point: he couldn’t forgive himself for the mistake that tarnished the beauty of a creative idea. Like an artist, Tal was deeply hurt by the very thought that a work of art was corrupted.
The ill-fated seventh-round game had far-reaching repercussions. Tal was psychologically exhausted and played without inspiration; he agreed four pallid draws and then lost to Boleslavsky. Only after defeating Petrosian and Klaman did he manage to finally overcome the crisis.
“Do you want to know how Tal wins? It’s very simple: he places the pieces in the center and then sacrifices them somewhere,” Bronstein once said.
This joke did have a grain of truth in it. Tal usually prepares his combinations quite thoroughly.

The white pieces are positioned perfectly: the rooks and the knight are ready to land a decisive strike, and the queen has disorganized the defense. Black’s pieces are positioned quite awkwardly, and the king is stuck in the center. A beautiful combination follows:

This Zwischenzug is the point of white’s combination. Klaman expected the obvious-looking 28.Qxf8+ Kc7, after which there’s no 29.Qxf6 due to 29...b3! Now, however, black is quickly crushed.
28...Qd5 29.Qxf8+ Kc7 30.Qxf6 Re8 31.Rc1 Ba4 32.Qd4! Qb7 33.Rd1 Re6 34.Qc4+ Black resigned
(34...Kd7 35.Nc5+).
The game Tal – Aronin, from round 17, was called “the most interesting draw in the history of chess” by the ex-world champion Max Euwe.
No. 27
M. Tal – L. Aronin
1957, Moscow, 24th Soviet Championship Final, round 17
Here’s the starting position of this captivating tactical struggle.
25.h5!
The only attacking resource. After the natural 25.f3, black avoided any danger with 25...Bh5. (
Editor’s note:
In this case, white’s position would be difficult because of the pawn’s weakness and the king’s compromised position. The game move leads to complicated tactical play and is best from the practical point of view, even though it still loses if the opponent plays perfectly.)
25.h5! Rad8
Editor’s note:
With 25...Red8!, Aronin could refute his opponent’s plan and win. The point is, after 26.hxg6 Rxd3 27.Rxd3, black plays 27...fxg6!, repelling the attack (the move 28.f7+ makes no sense if the rook isn’t on e8) and retaining a decisive material advantage. 27.gxh7+ (instead of 27.Rxd3) doesn’t help either: 27...Kh8 28.Rxd3 (hoping to create some serious threats along the g-file) – for instance, after 28...Qe8! (intending to activate the queen if possible) 29.Rg3 Be2! 30.Rhg1 Bh5, there’s no way for white to continue the attack.
26.hxg6! Rxd3
26...hxg6 is bad because of 27.Qxd8 Rxd8 28.Rxd8 Qxd8 29.Rh8+ Kxh8 30.Nxf7+ Kg8 31.Nxd8 with a won endgame.
27.Rxd3
White gets only a rook for the queen, but the black king’s precarious position allows him to create strong threats.
27...hxg6 28.Rh7!
Threatening 29.f3. If the bishop retreats to h5, there follows 30.Rd7, and if it goes to e6, the other rook can be transferred to the h-file through d2.
Aronin decides to eliminate the dangerous adversary, the f6 pawn, which leads to a draw by force.
28...Rc8! 29.f3 Rc6! 30.Rxf7
30.fxg4 Rxf6 31.Rdh3 was dangerous due to 31...Rf2+ and then Qd6. (
Editor’s note:
White is simply lost after that.)
30...Qxf7 31.Nxf7 Kxf7 32.fxg4 Kxf6 33.Rd7 Rb6 34.Kc3 Kg5 35.a4 a6 36.Kc4 Kxg4
The opponents
agreed a draw
because of the unavoidable repetition: 37.Kc5 Rc6+ 38.Kd5 Rb6 39.Kc5 Rc6+.
Before the last round, Bronstein, Tolush and Tal all led the tournament. Chess fans anxiously waited for the answer to their most important question: who’s going to be the national champion?
“I’m glad to be playing Tolush! He’s a true fighter, he won’t avoid a sharp struggle,” said Tal happily before the game.
On the way to the playing hall, he joked a lot and quoted from
The Twelve Chairs
extensively. (Analysis of this novel was later the topic of Tal’s university degree dissertation.)
I walked silently and thought, “Such an important day for him, and he just jokes around!”
There were a lot of people at the entrance of the Rail Workers House of Culture. We somehow managed to squeeze into the building.
“This is a good sign!” Tal laughed when he saw that almost all the buttons were torn from his coat.
No. 28, King’s Indian Defense
M. Tal – A. Tolush
1957, Moscow, 24th Soviet Championship Final, round 21
1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 g6 3.e4 d6 4.d4 Bg7 5.f3 e5 6.Nge2 Nbd7
Editor’s note:
In modern times, strong players don’t usually play this line for black. 6...0-0 is more flexible, not committing to any move of the Nb8 just yet. However, black usually castles even one move earlier (5...0-0), getting maximum freedom in choosing the subsequent plans.
7.Bg5 c6 8.Qd2 0-0 9.d5
9...c5
Editor’s note:
This move is a big mistake that leads to a strategically lost game: by closing off the c-file, Tolush loses all chances of good counterplay and allows his opponent to fully concentrate on attacking the king. The correct move is 9...cxd5 10.cxd5 a6 or 9...h6 10.Be3 (10.Bxh6?! Nxe4! 11.Nxe4 Qh4+; 10.Bh4? Nxe4!) 10...cxd5 11.cxd5 a6, intending b7-b5 in both cases.
10.g4 a6 11.Ng3 Re8 12.h4 Qa5
This foray is too hasty. Black should have first finished his development with 12...Nf8 and Bd7.
13.Bh6 Nf8 14.h5 Qc7 15.Bd3 b5
Tolush launches a counter-attack. He hopes to create threats on the queenside after the pawn sacrifice.
16.0-0-0 b5xc4 17.Bb1!
After 17.Bxc4 Bd7 and Bb5, black gets counterplay. (
Editor’s note:
Actually, after 17.Bxc4 Bd7 18.Nf5!, white has a decisive attack, so black just has no time to get any counterplay. Instead of 17...Bd7, black has a stronger move 17...Bxh6 18.Qxh6 Kh8 with the subsequent Nf6-g8, even though his position is still very bad. However, it’s possible that Tal already thought that the light-squared bishop would be more useful for him on the b1-h7 diagonal.)
17...Bh8
Editor’s note:
Here too, 17...Bxh6 18.Qxh6 Kh8, with the idea Nf6-g8, was more resilient.
18.Rdg1
White’s artillery takes up position.
18...Rb8 19.Nf5!
The cavalry goes on the attack.
19...N6d7
Black shouldn’t accept the sacrifice: after 19...gxf5 20.gxf5+ Ng6 21.hxg6 hxg6 22.fxg6 white opens lines for a decisive attack.
20.Bg5 Bg7 21.Nxg7 Kxg7 22.Bh6+ Kg8
White already has a considerable positional advantage: the dark-squared bishop, an important defensive piece, has been eliminated, and the h-file is open for the attack. However, this advantage is not enough for a win in itself. With his next moves, white redeploys the necessary reserves to the kingside for a final blow.
23.f4!
To prevent the threat of 24.f5, black has to take the pawn.
23...exf4 24.Qxf4 Qd8! 25.hxg6
25.Qxd6 was bad. After 25...Rb6 and 26...Ne5, black fortifies his position.
25...Nxg6 26.Qh2 Nde5 27.Bf4
Editor’s note:
This move is a mistake that gives his opponent some chances to save the game. The strongest continuation was 27.Bd2! (not allowing the opponent to trade that bishop) 27...Nf8 28.Qh6, intending to get the knight to the kingside through d1 or e2. If necessary, the d2 bishop can move to c3, protecting the b2 pawn and immobilizing the e5 knight.
27...Nf8
As analysis subsequently showed, black could have put up more resistance with 27...Nxf4. After 28.Qxh7+ Kf8 29.Qh6+ Ke7 30.Qxf4 Kd7, white has got nothing concrete, while after 28.Qxf4 he would have to continue the attack without the important dark-squared bishop.
28.Qh6
(threatening
B
f4-g5-f6)
28...Neg6 29.Bg5 f6
30.e5!!
This pawn move is like a stick of dynamite that blows up black’s position. The bishop and the knight join the attack, and this swiftly decides matters.
30...Rxe5
After 30...fxg5, Tal intended to play 31.Bxg6 hxg6 32.Qh8+ Kf7 33.Rh7+!
31.Bxg6 Rb7
Black is desperately trying to defend a hopeless position. 31...hxg6 didn’t help due to 32.Qh8+ and 33.Rh7+!
32.Ne4! fxg5 33.Rf1 Rxe4
To prevent the threat 34.Nf6, black has to give up an exchange.
34.Bxe4 Rg7 35.Rf6 Bxg4
If 35...Ng6, then 36.Rxg6.
36.Rhf1 Nd7 37.Rxd6 Qe7 38.Rxa6 Kh8 39.Bxh7! Nb8 40.Bf5+ Kg8 41.Be6+! Bxe6 42.Rxe6
Tolush stopped the clock
after this move.
In the eight games against grandmasters, Tal got a brilliant result – six points. His last victory earned him the grandmaster’s title as well.
Several minutes later, applause rang out in the hall again: Bronstein had agreed to a draw with Kholmov. And so, Mikhail Tal became Soviet champion.
The thunderous ovation seemed unending. The spectators wouldn’t leave the hall for ages, celebrating the young player’s victory.
The next morning, the new champion’s room was full of journalists and newspaper photographers. Telegrams of congratulations poured in from many cities of the Soviet Union; most of them were from Riga, of course. Tal was very excited. When he saw me, he showed me one of them. It contained greetings from the Latvian Communist Party Central Committee.*
* Tal’s relations with the Central Committee would become a lot more complicated a few years later, as recounted in his first wife Sally Landau’s memoir
Checkmate! The Love Story of Mikhail Tal and Sally Landau
(Elk and Ruby, 2019, short-listed for the English Chess Federation Book of the Year prize) – publisher’s note
And then the routine days came, with mundane tasks and concerns. Tal had to finish his degree dissertation and then get a school internship as a literature teacher. He also had a lot of public duties: simultaneous displays at affiliated organizations, and lectures at factories, state entities and schools. He also had to find some time to read books and go to the theater and cinema. Should we add that the Soviet champion also had to train...
In summer 1957, Tal played in the students’ world team championship and European team championship, and in the autumn he took part in the Latvian players’ tour in Italy. In all these competitions, Tal posted the highest individual score.
The following two games were played in the European team championship.
No. 29, Ruy Lopez
M. Tal – R. Teschner
1957, Vienna, 1st European Team Championship, round 2
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 d6 6.c3 Be7 7.d4
Editor’s note:
The main line here is 7.Re1.
7...b5 8.Bb3 Bg4 9.h3
Editor’s note:
In later games, the strongest players usually chose 9.Be3.
9...Bxf3 10.Qxf3
10...exd4
Black accepts the pawn sacrifice. However, the quiet 10...0-0 also allowed white great prospects in the center and on the kingside.
11.Qg3 g6
Editor’s note:
In most subsequent games with this line, black played 11...0-0. In this case, the main line is 12.Bh6 Ne8 13.Bd5 Qd7 14.Qg4! Qxg4 15.hxg4. The stats are catastrophic for black, but that doesn’t correlate with an objective evaluation of the position – analysis shows that black is only marginally worse.
12.Bd5 Qd7 13.Bh6 Rb8
The king voluntarily stays in the center and falls to a crushing attack. However, after 13...0-0-0 14.a4!, white’s attack was dangerous as well.
Editor’s note:
The computer shows interesting resources: 13...Rg8!? (with the idea 14...g5, and if 14.f4, then 14...Bf8 15.Bg5 Nxd5 16.exd5 Ne7) and 13...g5!? (capturing the pawn with the queen, let alone the bishop, loses to 14...Rg8) – in both cases, black is alright.
14.f4
Editor’s note:
The stronger move was 14.Re1!, to meet 14...Na5 (the move that could give black good chances to resist after 14.f4) with the simple 15.cxd4, not fearing 15...c6, because after 16.Bb3, the e4 pawn is still protected.
14...Nd8
Editor’s note:
14...Na5 still gave some defending chances. If white plays 15.Nd2 like in the actual game, then 15...Nxd5 16.exd5 Qf5 – the knight’s position on a5 gives black an important defensive resource Na5-c4.
15.Nd2 c6 16.Bb3 dxc3 17.Qxc3 Qa7+ 18.Kh1 Qc5 19.Qd3!
Threatening 20.Bg7 Rg8 21.Bxf6, then 22.e5 and Ne4.
19...Nd7 20.e5! d5
(a futile attempt to avoid opening the files)
21.f5!
Black can’t capture the e-pawn: 21...Nxe5 22.Qe2 f6 23.fxg6 hxg6 24.Bg7, and white’s attack is unstoppable.
Editor’s note:
Actually, 21...Nxe5 was the only way for black to stay in the game. Koblenz’s line is not dangerous for him at all: after the subsequent 24...Rh7 25.Bxf6 (25.Rxf6 Ndf7) 25...Bxf6 26.Rxf6 Re7, he’s alright. Instead of the erroneous 22.Qe2, the correct move is 22.Qg3, and after 22...f6 23.fxg6 hxg6 24.Bg7 Ndf7 (24...Rh7? 25.Rxf6 Rxg7 26.Qxe5+–, 24...Rh5? 25.Bxf6 Bxf6 26.Rxf6 Ndf7 27.Rxg6+–, 24...Rg8? 25.Bxf6+– or 25.Ne4+–) 25.Rae1 Qd6 26.Bxh8 Nxh8 27.Nf3 Nhf7 28.Bc2 Nxf3 29.Qxd6 Nxd6 30.Bxg6+ Kd7 31.Rxf3 Rg8, black has some good chances in the endgame.
So, instead of Tal’s 21.f5?!, it’s much better to play 21.Rac1, first pushing the black queen to a worse position (and preventing it from reaching d6, as in the previous line), and then getting a decisive attack in all lines: 21...Qb6 22.f5+–, 21...Qa7 22.f5+–, 21...Qb4 22.a3 Nc5 (22...Qa5 23.f5 Nxe5 24.Qg3+–) 23.Qe3 Qa5 24.f5+–.
21...gxf5 22.Qxf5 Nf8 23.Ne4! dxe4 24.Rac1! Qb6 25.Rcd1 Black resigned.
International master Rudolf Teschner lost the second game to Tal as well, which was a quieter one.
No. 30, Sicilian Defense
R. Teschner – M. Tal
1957, Vienna, 1st European Team Championship, round 5
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 d6 6.g3 g6
7.Bg2
Editor’s note:
If strong modern grandmasters go for this line, they usually place their hopes of getting an opening advantage in 7.Nxc6 bxc6 8.Bg2 or 7.Nde2.
7...Nxd4 8.Qxd4 Bg7 9.0-0 0-0 10.Qd3 Be6 11.Nd5 Rc8 12.c3 Re8 13.Be3 Qa5 14.h3
14...Qa4!
Tal wrote about this maneuver: “The most difficult move in the whole game. Black constrains white’s queenside pawns even more, puts pressure on the e4 square and prepares b7-b5-b4.”
15.Rfe1 b5 16.Bg5
It was better to simplify the position with 16.Nxf6+ Bxf6 17.Bd4 Bxd4 18.cxd4 Rc7, even though black still had an advantage after this move.
Editor’s note:
Judging by Koblenz’s last note, it’s clear that he thinks that the position after 15...b5 is better for black, but this evaluation is too optimistic. For instance, his line can be continued with 19.d5 Bd7 20.e5, and white is no worse. 16.Nb4!? is also worth considering, preventing the opponent’s possible queenside initiative (16...a5?? 17.b3 Qa3 18.Bc1+–) – there’s no reason to believe that black has an advantage. However, the game move should’ve led to equality as well.
16...Nxd5 17.exd5 Bf5 18.Qd2 b4 19.c4 Qc2!
Finishing the maneuver that was started on move 14.
After the queen trade, the bishops will put a lot of pressure on the opponent’s queenside.
20.Qxc2 Bxc2 21.Rac1 Bd3
22.Re3
Editor’s note:
White’s last move is a mistake and leads to a lost position; however, after 22.b3 Bb2 23.Rcd1 Bc2 24.Re2 Bf6 (after 24...Bxd1?! 25.Rxb2, only black is at risk due to big problems with the d1 bishop) 25.Rxc2 Bxg5 26.a4 bxa3 27.Ra2, the position was completely drawn.
22...Bxb2! 23.Rxd3 Bxc1 24.Bxc1 Rxc4 25.Bd2 Rb8! 26.Be3 a5 27.Rd2 a4 28.Bf1 Rc1 29.Rb2 Ra1 30.Kg2 a3 31.Rc2 b3 32.axb3 a2! 33.Be2 Rg1+ 34.Kxg1 a1=Q+ 35.Kg2 Rxb3 36.Rc8+ Kg7 37.Rc4 Qa8 38.Bd4+ e5
In this hopeless position,
white lost on time
.
Tal is often criticized for his excessively risky opening play. Indeed, he often cedes a dangerous initiative to his opponents when he plays black.
Let’s look at a game played in a match in Italy.
No. 31, Modern Benoni
E. Romani – M. Tal
1957, Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia-Riga Match
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 c5 4.d5 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 6.Nf3 g6
In this system, black has a weakness on d6. His opponent also gets a space advantage in the center. However, black has a chance to create counterplay with the long-range g7 bishop and queenside pawn advantage. Even though the common opinion is that this line is difficult for black, Tal often employs it in important tournaments. Such “balancing on the edge of the abyss”, where even the smallest mistake made by his opponent allows him to launch a swift counterattack, always attracted Tal.
7.g3
The game can get much sharper after 7.Nd2 Bg7 8.Nc4 0-0 9.Bf4 Ne8 10.Qd2.
In this case, black would’ve played 10...b6! For instance, 11.e3 Ba6 12.a4 Bxc4 (
Editor’s note:
Another popular move in this position is 12...f5!?, seizing kingside space, but a different move worth considering is 12...Nd7!?, as played in the game Chakravarthi – Mareco, Dubai 2018. After the subsequent 13.Be2 Bxc4 14.Bxc4 the white bishop got to c4, but a tempo down) 13.Bxc4 a6 14.0-0 Nd7 15.Rab1 f5 16.Bg3 Qf6 17.f4 Nc7 with the subsequent b6-b5 (
Editor’s note:
Later, this unclear position with mutual chances occurred in the games Borisenko – Suetin, Riga 1958, and Lomholt Hansen – Kretschmer, corr. 1983).
Tal once played a paradoxical move 10...Bxc3 (instead of 10...b6), and after 11.bxc3 b5 12.Nb2, at the cost of trading off the important dark-squared bishop, got an opportunity to push his pawn phalanx. (
Editor’s note:
Koblenz probably means the game Borisenko – Tal, Riga 1955; there followed 12...a5 13.e4 Qe7 14.Bd3 b4. But in his other games that reached the position after 12.Nb2, Tal played 12...Bb7 – see Lebedev – Tal, Riga 1955, and Antoshin – Tal, Leningrad 1956. By the way, the idea 10...Bxc3 11.bxc3 b5 found adherents among other strong players.)
7...Bg7 8.Bg2 0-0 9.0-0 a6 10.a4 Nbd7 11.Nd2 Re8
12.Nc4
12.a5 could be met with 12...b5 13.axb6 Nxb6 14.Nb3 Nc4! 15.Qd3 Rb8!, and white can’t implement his plan to block black’s queenside with Na5.
Editor’s note:
Instead of the inaccurate 15.Qd3, white usually plays 15.Ra4, but even then after 15...Nb6 16.Ra2 Nc4, black is alright, and most of the games that came to this position ended with three-fold repetition (17.Ra4 Nb6). We should also point out that today’s main line is 12.h3.
12...Nb6
Preventing white from increasing the pressure on the d6 pawn with 13.Bf4.
Editor’s note:
In modern practice, 12...Ne5 is more popular.
13.Ne3
Editor’s note:
In subsequent games, white usually played 13.Na3, which is considered the current main line in this position.
13...Ng4! 14.Qb3 Rb8 15.h3 Nxe3 16.Bxe3 Nd7 17.Ne4 Qe7 18.Bf4 Ne5
Now everything is ready to execute black’s main strategic idea: the b7-b5 pawn advance.
19.Qb6
A bad attempt to prevent b7-b5.
Editor’s note:
The best continuation was 19.a5, with a complicated position.
19...Nc4 20.Qb3 b5 21.axb5 axb5 22.g4
22.Nxc5 didn’t work because of 22...g5!
22...Bxb2
Editor’s note:
The correct move is 22...f5! 23.Nxc5 g5 24.Bh2 Nd2, winning an exchange – there’s no good compensation for white.
23.Nxd6
Editor’s note:
The unexpected 23.Ra5!? looks interesting – after both 23...Nxa5 24.Qxb2 and 23...Bd7 24.Ra7, white has a considerable initiative for the material.
Both players have executed their plans. Black has gained a pawn advantage on the queenside, and white likewise in the center. In the subsequent stage of the game, tactics come to the fore.
23...Bxa1 24.Nxc4
24.Nxe8 is worse because of 24...Be5!
24...Ra8 25.Nb6
The tempting 25.Qxb5 Qxe2 26.Bf3 was refuted by the spectacular 26...Ba6!!. (
Editor’s note:
Instead of 26.Bf3, the correct move is 26.Qxc5 with enough compensation for the exchange. However, black’s play can be improved as well: instead of the mistake 25...Qxe2, he had 25...Ba6 and 26...Qxe2 with an advantage.)
25...Ra5 26.d6 Qa7 27.Bc6 Be6 28.Qc2
Editor’s note:
28.Qf3! gave adequate compensation for the exchange, keeping the possibility to meet Nd5 Bxd5 with Qxd5; also, the white queen can get to f6 from f3 in some lines. For instance: 28...Rd8 (after 28...Rb8? 29.Nd5 Bxd5 30.Qxd5, black faces huge problems because of the threat d6-d7) 29.Nd5 Bg7 30.Bg5 Rxd6 31.Nf6+ Kf8 (31...Bxf6?? 32.Qxf6+–, 31...Kh8?! 32.Qg3!, threatening both Qxd6 and Qh4) 32.Nxh7+ Kg8 33.Nf6+ Kf8 34.Nh7+ with perpetual check. However, after the weaker game move white still has some chances to save the game.
28...Rb8 29.Nd5 Bxd5 30.Bxd5 Ra4 31.e3
31...Bg7
Editor’s note:
31...Bf6 is stronger, because after the subsequent 32.Rd1 c4 white can’t play 33.d7 due to 33...Rd8. However, if the bishop is on g7, it’s all different (see the next editor’s note).
32.Bc6?
(32.
R
d1 was better)
Editor’s note:
Analysis of the position after 32.Rd1 shows that in that case white had enough compensation for the exchange to draw the game. Unlike the aforementioned line 31...Bf6, black can’t now play 32...c4 due to 33.d7 – in this case, 33...Rd8 loses due to 34.Qe4! Qxd7 35.Bxf7+ (the rook on d8 is unprotected – 35...Qxf7 36.Rxd8+).
32...Qb6 33.Bd5 Rxf4! 34.exf4 Qxd6
The dangerous d6 pawn is eliminated, and the black pawns can finally march forward.
35.Qe4 Rd8 36.Bc6 b4 37.Ba4 Qd4! 38.Qe7 Bf6 39.Qb7 Qxf4 40.Bb3 c4 41.Bc2 Be5 42.Qg2 b3 43.Bb1 c3 White resigned.
December 1957 came. The names of the semi-final winners became known, and we were able to study the games of our future opponents, their strengths and weaknesses, and plan the championship strategy accordingly.
In the week preceding the 25th Soviet championship, we played several training games. I’ll allow myself the pleasure of printing two of them.
No. 32, Dutch Opening
A. Koblenz – M. Tal
1957, Riga, Training Match, round 1
1.d4 e6 2.c4 f5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.g3 Be7 5.Bg2 0-0 6.Nf3 d6 7.0-0 Qe8 8.Re1! Qg6 9.e4 fxe4 10.Nxe4 Nxe4 11.Rxe4 Nc6
11...Qxe4? 12.Nh4
12.Re3
At first glance, this rook retreat is illogical because it blocks the dark-squared bishop. However, as will soon become clear, the rook performs important functions on the third rank.
Editor’s note:
This move hasn’t found much traction at grandmaster level. The current main line is 12.Qe2.
12...Bf6
12...e5 is bad because of 13.dxe5 Bg4 14.exd6 Bxd6 15.c5! Be7 16.b4! Bf6 17.Bb2! It’s easy to notice that the rook defends the knight on f3.
13.d5 exd5 14.cxd5 Ne5
Editor’s note:
The aggressive 14...Nb4!? looks like a good alternative.
15.Nxe5 Bxe5 16.Rb3
That’s the reason behind 12.Re3. Now, after the natural 16...b6 17.Be3, white will play 18.Rac1 and create strong pressure along the c-file.
16...Bf5!
Launching an interesting counter-attack. Black isn’t going to defend the b7 pawn!
17.Rxb7 Bc2! 18.Qd2
The dark-squared bishop is stuck on c1 and will now hinder white’s queenside development.
Editor’s note:
The moves 18.Qe1 and 18.Qe2 were worth considering.
18...Rae8 19.Rxc7 Bd3
Black avoids the trap: 19...Bd4 20.Qxd4 Re1+ 21.Bf1 Bd3 22.Bh6!!.
20.Qb4 a5! 21.Qa4 Bxg3!
21...Rxf2 22.Kxf2 Qf6+ gave black nothing due to 23.Kg1 (but not 23.Bf3 Bd4+ 24.Kg2 Bf1+) 23...Bd4+ 24.Be3.
22.hxg3 Re1+ 23.Kh2 Be4! 24.Be3
Of course, not 24.Bxe4 due to a mate in two: 24...Qh5+ 25.Kg2 Qh1#.
24...Qh5+ 25.Bh3 Rxe3!
26.Rxg7+!
This rook counter-sacrifice saves white from losing. 26.fxe3 immediately lost to 26...Qe2+.
26...Kxg7
If 26...Kh8, then 27.Qd4! Rxf2+ 28.Kg1, and the discovered check threat is decisive.
Editor’s note:
In Koblenz’s line, instead of 27...Rxf2+, black should play 27...Rd3!, and the computer lines show that after both 28.Qxe4 Rd2 29.Rc7 Rdxf2+ 30.Kg1 Qxh3 and 28.Rxh7+ Kxh7 29.Qxe4+ Qg6, the game ends in a draw.
27.Qd4+ Kg8 28.Qxe3
The queen finally joins the defense, but black still has the initiative.
28...Bf5 29.g4 Bxg4 30.Rg1 Rxf2+!
Another rook sacrifice!
31.Kh1! Qxd5+ 32.Bg2 Qd2 33.Qxd2 Rxd2 34.Bh3 h5 35.Bxg4 hxg4 36.Rxg4+ Kf7 37.Rg2 Draw.
In the next game, our purpose was to check a line in the Sicilian Defense that Tal intended to use in the championship. I was his opponent.

After capture by the f-pawn, white still has good prospects.
Editor’s note:
Subsequent practice shows that 15...fxg6 is the only correct move. After 16.h5 gxh5 17.Rxh5 Nf6, white’s compensation is substantial, but this doesn’t mean it will necessarily bring an advantage.
16.h5 gxh5 17.Rxh5 Nf6 18.Rh1 d5! 19.e5!
Editor’s note:
There’s a much simpler and quieter continuation shown by Timman: 19.Bf4! Bd6 20.Bxd6 Qxd6 21.f4 with the ideas 22.e5, 22.Qh2 or 22.Bd3 — white’s position is won.
19...Nxe5 20.Bf4
Editor’s note:
This is a mistake: for some reason, white forces the black bishop to go to d6, where its position is quite good, with the black king getting a good escape square e7 in the process. The correct move was 20.Qh2 Kf8 21.Qh8+ Ng8 (Burgess) 22.Bd4!, and, even though great complications arise, white is ultimately able to prove that his attack is decisive.
20...Bd6 21.Qh2 Kf8 22.Qh8+
Editor’s note:
The prophylactic 22.Kb1 is better, even though after 22...Ke7 white still has to prove that his activity is worth the two missing pawns.
22...Ng8
22...Ke7 was stronger, but I intended to lure the queen to h8 and get it out of play. (
Editor’s note:
22...Ke7 wasn’t just “stronger” – it led to a won position; whereas, after the game move, white’s compensation is adequate.)
23.Rh7 f5 24.Bh6 Rd7 25.Bxb5! Rf7

Tal wrote about this position in the
Sahs
magazine: “...The white pieces aren’t positioned too well. The g7 square – the key to black’s position – bends, but doesn’t break. If black can bolster his position and launch an attack, then white will only manage to send a consolation telegram to his king. So white has to play very energetically.”
27.Nd4
Editor’s note:
As Burgess pointed out, white won with 27.Bxa6! Bxa6 (27...Rxa6 28.Rgxg7+–; 27...Nxf3 28.Nb5+–) 28.Nd4 Bc8 29.Ndb5+–.

Black is a piece down, but his opponent has three pieces en prise!

With a futile hope of launching a counter-attack after 30.bxc3 axb5 31.Nxa7 Qxa7. (
Editor’s note:
After the subsequent 32.Rh1 black still can’t save the game, but instead of 31.Nxa7?!, white wins immediately with 31.gxf5 exf5 32.Rgxg7 Rxg7 33.Nxa7+–.)

Editor’s note:
This move gives the opponent an opportunity to defend. The correct move was 32.gxf5 (Burgess) or 32.g5 (threatening 33.Qxg8+ Kxg8 34.g6+–) 32...Qg3 33.g6! Qxg6 34.Ne5 — with a decisive attack in both cases.

A Ticket to the Interzonal
In January 1958, the participants of the 25th Soviet championship arrived in Riga. The Science Palace became the arena for the national battle for the gold medal. Further, four representatives of the Soviet Union would qualify for the Interzonal – a world championship cycle tournament.
The decision to hold the jubilee championship in Latvia’s capital was met with enthusiasm from our chess players. Riga is a city with a great chess tradition. The outstanding grandmaster Aron Nimzowitsch lived there, while the stunningly beautiful endgame studies of Hermanis Matisons were created here – he was the first Latvian chess master. Riga is the birthplace of an original opening that was named the Latvian Gambit (its inventor was Karlis Betins). Latvian chess players won many correspondence matches against other European cities. However, all these successes were the result of individual enthusiasts’ efforts. The mass chess movement in bourgeois Latvia was an unattainable dream. Only in Soviet Latvia would chess finally achieve its deserved place in the republic’s cultural life.
The first round. All participants are full of hope and in a combative mood.
On the third hour of play, the first applause sounded: Tal had started the championship with a win! The arbiters had a hard time trying to calm the spectators down and restore order.
The critical position occurred after move 18.
No. 34
M. Tal – A. Tolush
1958, Riga, 25th Soviet Championship Final, round 1
Tolush expected his opponent to exchange queens and settle for a draw. He seemed to underestimate Tal’s next move.
19.Be5! Qb5
Editor’s note:
The move 19...a5!? looked good — it both activated the rook and prevented b4-b5, which could have both created a foothold on c6 for the knight and fixed the a-pawn in place. After, for instance, 20.bxa5 bxa5 21.Rd4 a4 22.Bc2 a3 23.bxa3 Rxa3 24.Qb1 Bc6, black’s position is totally defensible.
20.Bxf6 gxf6
20...Nxf6 was relatively better. However, after 21.Qe7 Bd5 22.Bxd5 Nxd5 23.Qb7 Rd8 24.h4, the knight pin would be very unpleasant for black.
Editor’s note:
White’s extra pawn after the subsequent 24...Qd7! 25.Qxd7 (25.Qa6?! Qe7=) 25...Rxd7 26.Ne5 Rd6 27.b5 Kf8 28.Nc6 Rd7 29.Nb4 Nf6 30.Rxd7 Nxd7 31.Nc6 Ke8 32.Nxa7 Ke7 probably can’t be converted at all. The game move is the decisive mistake.
21.Qe4 Qxb4 22.Nd4 f5 23.Qe5! Ne7 24.Qf6 Bd5
After 24...Rf8, Tal prepared the following line: 25.h3 Bd5 26.Rd3 Bxb3 27.Rg3+! Ng6 28.Nxf5, and black can’t save the game.
Now, a beautiful finale ensues.
25.Nc6! Qxb3 26.Nxe7+ Kf8 27.Re1 Be6 28.Nxf5 Black resigned.
In round 3, Isaak Boleslavsky had black against Tal. Knowing that Boleslavsky liked to play the King’s Indian, Tal opted against his favorite 1.e2-e4 and started the game with the queen’s pawn move: he found a new strategic plan in a well-known KID line which gave white an advantage in the opening.
The novelty was successful – Tal won a pawn.
The diagram shows the position after black’s 19th move.
No. 35
M. Tal – I. Boleslavsky
1958, Riga, 25th Soviet Championship Final, round 3
20.Rg2
This move looks very strong. White activates the rook and threatens to win the d6 pawn. However, this seemingly logical move dulled Tal’s attention, and he overlooked the positional counter-threat.
20...b5!
The b-pawn movement wouldn’t have been as effective had white played 20.Rb1. In this case, 20...b5 would have been met with 21.b3.
20.Rg2 b5! 21.Nf3
As Boleslavsky showed after the game, white could have taken on b5. After 21.cxb5 Nxd5 22.Nxd6, he had two extra pawns. However, after 22...Nf4 or 22...Rad8, black seized the initiative. In case of 21.Nxd6 bxc4 22.Nxc4 (if 22.Bxc4, then 22...Rab8!) 22...Nxd5, white retained the extra pawn, but black still had dangerous counterplay. (
Editor’s note:
after Koblenz’s 22.Bxc4 Rab8, there’s 23.Rxg7!, and after 23...Kxg7 24.Re1! Nb6 25.Re7+ Kg8 26.Rxc7 Rbd8 27.Rxc5 Rxd6 28.b3 Rxf5 29.Ne2, the ending is drawn. However, instead of 22...Rab8, black could play 22...Ne5! or 22...Nb6!, and white’s position is difficult.)
The game move illustrates Tal’s creative credo very well: to activate his pieces, he gladly returns the extra pawn.
21...bxc4 22.Bxc4 Rab8 23.Rb1
Editor’s note:
It was better to try 23.Rag1 Rxb2+ 24.Ke1 Rxg2 25.Rxg2, for instance, 25...Nb6 (25...Rxf5?! 26.Nfg5 with enough counterplay) 26.Be2 Nbxd5 27.Nxd6 and only a slight advantage for black.
23...Rxf5 24.Nfg5 Ne5
25.Bb3?
A failed attempt to complicate play. As Boleslavsky correctly pointed out, after 25.Nxd6 Nxc4+ 26.Nxc4 Rxd5+ 27.Kc2, black had only a minimal advantage, and white could easily draw the game. (
Editor’s note:
Instead of 25...Nxc4, black had 25...Rf6!, and after 26.Nge4 Rf4 27.Re2 Nxc4+ 28.Nxc4 Nxd5, it’s not that simple for white to equalize.)
25...c4 26.Bc2 Nxd5 27.Nxd6
Editor’s note:
It was necessary to play 27.Nc3, declining to restore the material advantage, but forcing the trade of at least one pair of pieces, which made the white king’s position much more comfortable and brought some hope of saving the game.
27...Rf6 28.Nf5
(28.
N
de4 was better)
Editor’s note:
28.Nde4 was unlikely to save the game: after 28...Rff8, black has an overwhelming advantage because of dangerous piece activity and white’s exposed king.
28...Rd8 29.Ke1 Nf4 30.Rg3 Ned3+
The white king is suddenly caught in the crossfire of his opponent’s pieces.
31.Bxd3 Nxd3+
White’s position is critical. Tal then sacrificed the exchange with
32.Rxd3
, but this didn’t help. His opponent precisely converted his material advantage and deservedly won on move 51.
We analyzed this game for a long time, creating a “case history”.
In this game, Tal fell victim to following a standard framework; he couldn’t make himself delve into the concrete features of the position, which, I should say, was a rare occurrence for him. Tal was criticized for various things, but adherence to frameworks wasn’t one of them. His high-risk approach, on the other hand, the fact that his sacrifices were, as a rule, unsound, was often discussed. However, anti-positional lunges at his opponent’s position don’t actually feature in Tal’s tournament practice all that often – they were mostly seen in the return match against Botvinnik. In actuality, the overwhelming majority of Tal’s sacrifices brought him success for the simple reason that they were justified.
Let’s take, for instance, the game against Averbakh from the same championship. Grandmaster Averbakh represents the so-called classical school in chess, preferring quiet and clear positions. He feels less confident in sharp situations and often gets into time trouble. We decided to play Tal’s “patented” sharp line in the Modern Benoni.

10.Nd2 was more precise. White likely didn’t anticipate that the Riga player would go for an unexpected combination just two moves later.
10...Na6 11.Bf4
The passive 11.a3 Nc7 12.Re1 Rb8 13.a4 (preventing b7-b5) 13...Na6 allowed black to occupy the b4 square.
11...Nb4 12.Qb1
12...Nxe4!!?
This move was very controversial. After looking at the position, Petrosian and Krogius smiled skeptically. After the game, they were firmly on the side of white, thinking that the sacrifice wasn’t correct. Bronstein, however, had a different opinion of this move. He wrote in the championship bulletin:
“Black’s position after white’s 12th move looks difficult from the strategic point of view. Tal gave 12...Nxe4 an exclamation mark and a question mark. I myself can’t help but give two exclamation marks to this move.
In such cases, the question whether the sacrifice is correct is not as important as the fact that Averbakh, the quintessential positional player, had to make a drastic turn in a completely different direction.
After 13.Nxe4 Bf5 14.Nfd2 Nxd5, white made a decisive mistake by playing 15.Bxd6 instead of the correct 15.Bg3.
It’s also interesting to note that Lilienthal thought that the sacrifice was incorrect, while Tal thought that chances were equal after 15.Bg3.
Such positions contain an unlimited number of possibilities, and the player who navigates the position better and calculates more quickly and precisely has more practical chances.”
Editor’s note:
12...Nh5!? looks interesting (and occurred in most subsequent games), intending f7-f5.
13.Nxe4 Bf5 14.Nfd2 Nxd5 15.Bxd6
A grave mistake. Black regains the piece and has a material advantage.
On the back of this blunder, most commentators came to the conclusion that the sacrifice wasn’t correct and was only justified with white’s “help”.
But let’s consider what would have happened after the strongest move 15.Bg3.
Tal intended to play 15...Qe7 16.Bb5 Bxe4 17.Nxe4 Qxe4 18.Bxe8 Qxe8 19.Bxd6 Qc6 20.Bg3 c4, and black has a pawn and queenside initiative for the exchange.
The position Tal aimed for isn’t to everyone’s liking, of course. The move 16.Bb5 is also not the only one – there was probably a stronger continuation.
Editor’s note:
Instead of 16.Bb5, white had 16.Bf3, with big trouble for black.
That said, analyzing the position in quiet conditions is one thing – you can move the pieces as much as you want and have all the time in the world. You can clarify a lot of things, find the right reply to a risky move, and reinforce your conclusion with a concrete line. Making a decision during a tense tournament game, when thinking time is strictly limited and when you’re facing a living opponent with their inherent strengths and weaknesses, is a whole other matter.
The player who is stronger in these difficult conditions, which are nevertheless equal for both players, will achieve success. That’s how we should evaluate committal decisions that cannot be fully evaluated during a tournament game.
The fact that Tal’s combination wasn’t a bluff was proved by Euwe, who found the move 15...Bh6 for black with the following lines:
a) 16.Bd3 Nb4 17.Re1 Nxd3 18.Qxd3 d5, and black wins;
Editor’s note:
Koblenz is wrong: white plays 19.Qxd5!, and, since 19...Bxd2 is bad because of 20.Nd6! Bxe1 21.Qxf7+ Kh8 22.Nxe8 Bxf2+ (22...Qxe8?? 23.Qf6+ Kg8 24.Be5+–) 23.Bxf2 Qxe8 24.Qxb7 with a positional advantage for white, black is forced to play 19...Qxd5 20.Nf6+ and 21.Nxd5, with a small advantage at the very most. But instead of 17...Nxd3?, black should play 17...Bxd2 18.Nxd2 Bxd3, getting two extra pawns and a won position.
b) 16.Qd3 Nb4 17.Qf3 (if 17.Qxd6, then 17...Bxd2 18.Qxd2 Qxd2 19.Nxd2 Rxe2) 17...Nc2, and white can’t avoid defeat;
Editor’s note:
In the line with 17.Qxd6, Euwe’s move 17...Bxd2 is a mistake because white wins after 18.Nf6+. The correct move is 17...Bxe4 18.Nxe4 Rxe4 19.Bf3 Rd4 20.Qxc5 Nd3 with an initiative.
c) 16.f4 Bg7, and white has no defense against numerous threats.
Editor’s note:
After the subsequent 17.Bb5, the position is totally unclear. However, the strongest reply to 15...Bh6 is 16.Bb5!, and after 16...Bxd2 17.Bxe8 Qxe8 18.Nxd6 (18.Qd1!?) 18...Bxb1 19.Nxe8 Bc2 20.Nd6, white gets an endgame with a minimal material advantage and some winning chances (Petersons – Khodos, Minsk 1964).
15...Nf6! 16.Bf3
Averbakh seeks to save the game with opposite-colored bishops, but the endgame is still far away. Black has a dangerous initiative.
16...Nxe4 17.Nxe4 Bxe4 18.Bxe4 Qxd6 19.Qc2 Re7 20.Bf3 Rae8 21.Rad1 Bd4 22.a4 b6 23.b3 Re5!
The rook is excellently placed here and can be transferred to the kingside for an attack.
24.Rd2 h5 25.Re2
White is trying to simplify the position with trades, but this doesn’t make defense any easier.
25...Rxe2 26.Bxe2 h4 27.Kh1 Qf4 28.g3 Qf6 29.Qd1 Rd8 30.Bg4 Bxf2! 31.Qe2
To attack the pinned bishop, white sacrifices a pawn, but he’s in for a surprise.
31...Rd2! 32.Qe8+ Kg7 33.gxh4 Qd4 34.Bh3 Qd3!
Editor’s note:
34...Qxh4–+ was stronger.
35.Bg2
After 35.Qe5+ Kh7 36.Qf6, black won with 36...Qd5+ 37.Bg2 Qxg2+ 38.Kxg2 Bxd4+ (
Editor’s note:
38...Bxh4+ is even better.)
35...Rd1! White resigned,
since the endgame after 36.Qb5 Qxb5 37.axb5 Rxf1+ 38.Bxf1 Bxh4 is hopeless.
Editor’s note:
The bishop endgame Koblenz ends his analysis with is most likely drawn – it’s probably impossible to create a passed pawn on the queenside with this pawn structure, and one passed pawn on the kingside is not enough for a win. Instead of 37...Rxf1+, black has a stronger move 37...Rd2, keeping the rooks, but the best continuation is 36...Rxf1+ 37.Bxf1 Qe4+ 38.Bg2 Qxh4 — with queens and opposite-colored bishops still on the board, white would have to fight off the passed pawns on both flanks and also defend his king. I think that black wouldn’t have too much difficulty converting his material advantage in this case.
When beginners overlook elementary threats, they are berated by their more knowledgeable friends. The game Tal – Korchnoi showed that even grandmasters are human.
No. 37
M. Tal – V. Korchnoi
1958, Riga, 25th Soviet Championship Final, round 9
White needs to settle for a draw: 33.Qf3 Qd5 34.Qf4 Qe5.
However, in time trouble Tal played
33.h6+? Rxh6 34.Qxh6+ Kxh6 35.g7 Qxg3+!
He overlooked this Zwischenschach and so had to
resign
on the spot.
This example is a small illustration on the subject of Tal’s “exceptional luck”, which was quite popular a few years ago. As we know, “good luck” and “bad luck” usually go hand-in-hand in chess.
The losses to Boleslavsky, Korchnoi and Anatoly Bannik didn’t break Tal’s will, but to get the ticket to the Interzonal, he now had to win a lot of games.
In round 10, Tal played Kotov. He won rather convincingly with subtle maneuvering in the opening and middlegame.
Against Taimanov, Tal went for an all-out attack. Repelling the first onslaught, Taimanov offered a draw, which was declined. The game was adjourned in a rook ending with Tal a pawn up, and after an eight-hour struggle, he won.
Seeing how persistent Tal was in trying to win the rook endgame, the Moscow journalist D. Ginzburg asked, “Why is Misha trying so hard? He has no chance for fourth place!”
In the game with Geller, Tal wanted to get the initiative at all cost. He sacrificed an exchange, then a full rook.
The people in the press center said indifferently, “Sow the wind, and reap the storm.” But the moves were sent to the press center with some delay; meanwhile, there was already applause in the hall.
What happened?
No. 38
M. Tal – E. Geller
1958, Riga, 25th Soviet Championship Final, round 14
When Tal made his 25th move, the Odessa grandmaster was standing near the arbiters’ table. Seeing the move on the demonstration board, he said, “If I take on f6 with the queen, the game is drawn, but I need to win!”
He headed to the board and grabbed the pawn with an energetic gesture.
25...gxf6?
Geller was absolutely right in his comment at the demonstration board: after 25...Qxf6 26.Qxf6 gxf6 27.d7, white’s passed pawn equalized chances. Now, however, black is losing.
25...gxf6? 26.Re7 Qxd6+
26...Qxe7 didn’t help due to 27.Qg4+.
27.Qxd6 Rxd6 28.Rxe1 Rd2 29.Rc1 Rxf2 30.Be4 Rxa2 31.Rxc4 a5 32.Rc8+ Kg7 33.Rc7 Black resigned.
This loss squashed Geller’s hopes of qualifying for the Interzonal. Even scrupulous analysis couldn’t refute Tal’s “incorrect” idea.
How can we explain black’s gross mistake in this game? I think that the main reason was that Geller wanted to win at all costs, regardless of the position.
Tal managed to improve his tournament standing somewhat after winning against grandmasters. However, he was sometimes too careless when he played against opponents who weren’t competing for the top places.
In his game against Furman, Tal teetered on the brink of catastrophe.
No. 39
M. Tal – S. Furman
1958, Riga, 25th Soviet Championship Final, round 16
White’s advantage is undoubtable. Furman also had less than two minutes for 12 moves. It seems that nothing can go wrong. However, Tal unexpectedly played the suicidal
29.g4?
He was mainly counting on his opponent’s time trouble. If black plays 29...Qh3, it’s met with 30.Qxe8+, while after 29...Qg6, there’s 30.Rf8+! Rxf8 31.Ne7+ Kh8 32.Nxg6+ and Rxf8+. However, Furman managed to find the right move.
29...Qh4
White lost an exchange, but everything ultimately ended in Tal’s favor: on move 38, Furman lost on time in a won position.
In the game against Krogius, Tal also had a bad position and only managed to draw after some help from his opponent.
Before the last round, Tal caught up with Petrosian. They led the table with 11.5 points each.
He had already clinched a ticked to the Interzonal, but the question of the new Soviet champion still remained open.
In the last round, the police had a lot of work on their plates. Hundreds of chess fans – those who failed to obtain tickets to the “chess palace” – gathered around the tall building. Only when the crowd was told that the key games would be broadcast in the Great Philharmonic Hall did they finally disperse.
The last round began.
Petrosian decided not to tempt fate and quickly agreed a draw with Averbakh.
The game Spassky – Tal became the center of attention. Tal played black and went for complications. He thought that he had better chances in a sharp struggle. Spassky played coolly and strongly. On move 23, Tal offered a draw in a roughly equal position, but Spassky declined. Just three moves later, Tal made a mistake, and his position quickly worsened.
The game was adjourned with a clear advantage for Spassky. Tal’s king was threatened by his opponent’s queen and rook.

1958, Riga, 25th Soviet Championship Final, round 19
That’s how the most gloomy analysis that we had ever carried out began... It continued until five in the morning. The more we studied the position, the worse the problems that we saw.
The resumption was in the morning. More than a thousand chess fans filled the playing hall. Others gathered at their TVs, eagerly awaiting the outcome of this captivating game.
48.Qf8+ Kf6 49.Qg7+ Ke7 50.Ra8! Qd7
Forced, because of the threat 51.Ra7+.
Editor’s note:
Analysis shows that after the game move, white could win with 51.Qh8!, preventing the black king from leaving e7. Afterwards, he strengthens the position with a kingside pawn storm, which ultimately creates the foundation for a decisive attack; in many lines, Qh8-b8 with the threat Ra8-a7 is an important resource.
So black had to play 50...Qf4+!, and only after 51.Kh3 Qf5+ 52.Kg3, play 52...Qd7. The principal difference is that now, with the king on g3, 53.Qh8 is met with 53...Qd6+ 54.Kh3 (if the king were on h2, white would have escaped to g1) 54...Qe6+ 55.g4 (or 55.Kh2 Rxg2+!) 55...Rh2+! 56.Kxh2 Qe2+ with perpetual check.
51.Qf8+? Kf6 52.Ra6+ Re6 53.Qh8+ Ke7 54.Ra8 Re1
Editor’s note:
The correct move is 54...h5!, pointed out by Kasparov. After this, white has no win.
55.Kg3
Editor’s note:
The computer wins with 55.Rc8! (white prevents the queen check from c7, that is very unpleasant in many lines, and threatens 56.g4), and meets 55...h5 with 56.f4!!, destroying the black king’s defense with f4-f5. However, the lines are very complicated.
55...h5
Preparing a safe haven for the king on f5.
Editor’s note:
This move again allows white to win the game. With 55...Qc7+ 56.Kf2 Re6, black equalizes: for instance, after 57.Qxh7 Qc2+ 58.Kg3 Re2, white has to go for perpetual check (59.Ra7+).
56.Kf2 Re6 57.Rc8
Editor’s note:
As D. Eschbach later found, white got a decisive attack with 57.Qb8! Kf6 58.g4!. The game move is weaker, but probably still doesn’t miss the win completely.
57...Rd6
Editor’s note:
This could have led to a quick loss, but analysis shows that even better moves were still inadequate: 57...Rc6 58.Qe5+ Re6 59.Qg5+ Rf6 60.Qc1! Qd6 61.Rc7+ Kd8 62.Rb7 Qf4 63.Qa1+– or 57...Rb6 58.Qf8+ Kf6 59.g4 Rb2+ 60.Kg3 Rb6 (60...hxg4 61.fxg4 Rd2 62.Rc3+–) 61.Qh8+ Ke7 62.Kf4 hxg4 63.Qf8+ Kf6 64.fxg4 Qd6+ 65.Qxd6 Rxd6 66.Re8+–.
58.Qf8+?
Vitaly Chekhover later showed in his analysis that white could win with 58.g4!.
Editor’s note:
Actually, this move doesn’t deserve a question mark: the g-pawn could have been pushed on the next move as well.
58...Kf6 59.Re8
Editor’s note:
This is a mistake. Kasparov’s 59.g4! was correct, with an irresistible attack for white.
59...Re6 60.Qh8+ Kf5 61.Qh6 Kf6 62.Qh8+
Editor’s note:
62.Rg8! still gave white winning chances (Kasparov).
62...Kf5 63.Rd8
It’s not too late to agree a draw, but Spassky only wants to win. (
Editor’s note:
The best move was 63.Qh6 Kf6 64.Rg8!, with the same position as after 62.Rg8!.)
63...Qc6! 64.Rc8?
The Leningrad grandmaster cracks under pressure. The correct move was 64.Kg3. Now Tal goes for a counter-attack.
Editor’s note:
This is not actually a mistake, Spassky missed the opportunity to draw only later.
64...Qa6 65.Kg3
Editor’s note:
This move doesn’t lose yet, but Spassky’s line 65.Qd8! Qe2+ 66.Kg3 led to an easier draw.
65...Qd6+ 66.Kh3 Re1
67.g3
67.g4+ hxg4+ 68.fxg4+ Kf4 69.Qh6+ was bad due to 69...Ke4! 70.Re8+ Kf3
Editor’s note:
Actually, 67.g4+ is the only move that allows white to save the game. In this line, instead of 69.Qh6+, the correct move is 69.Rc3!, and after the subsequent 69...Re3+ 70.Rxe3 Kxe3 71.h5 Kf4 72.h6 f6 73.Kg2 Qe7 74.Qb8+ Kg5 75.h7 Qxh7 76.Qb3 Qg8, there occurs a position that Kasparov also reached with a slightly different move order. However, if there were some doubts about its evaluation before, the computer now removes all of them: after 77.Qe3+ Kxg4 78.Qf3+, white draws.
67...Rg1
Editor’s note:
Not a good move. 67...Qa6 won immediately.
Only now Spassky offered a draw, but Tal declined.
68.f4 Re1! 69.Rc2
Editor’s note:
Kasparov’s recommendation 69.Re8! Rxe8 70.Qxe8 is more resilient, though it is still tough for white after 70...Qe6 due to his exposed d4-pawn.
69...Qe6 70.Rf2 Rh1+ 71.Kg2 Qe4+ 72.Rf3 Kg4 73.Qc8+ f5
, and
Spassky stopped the clock.
As soon as the sign “White resigned” appeared on the demonstration board, the spectators ran to the stage. The least disciplined ones hugged Tal, then started throwing him into the air.
The whole chess world learned the news: Mikhail Tal had won the Soviet championship for the second time.
Commenting on the “final of the final”, grandmaster Salo Flohr wrote in the
Ogonyok
magazine:
“‘This is only an accident’, the losers try to excuse themselves. But don’t they think that these ‘accidents’ happen quite regularly with Tal? How else can you explain the fact that Tal again scored the best result against the grandmasters (7/10)?
Let’s summarize: Mikhail Tal became the champion of the strongest chess country for the second time. Such great success can only be achieved by a talent as bright as the student from Riga.”
Not Fearsome to his Friends
This was proved in the 1958 Latvian SSR championship. Despite Tal’s huge reputation, his opponents in the republican tournament played him without fear. Many participants had played together with Tal in All-Union team tournaments or played against him in dozens of other tournaments. And so, they didn’t play against grandmaster Mikhail Tal, Soviet champion – they played against Misha Tal.
From the sporting point of view, Tal’s result was great – 16.5/19, however, his competitors Aivars Gipslis and Israel Zilber scored a half-point more, both defeating the Soviet champion.
The loss to Gipslis was a good lesson for Tal.
Before departing for the tournament hall, Tal started leafing through new chess magazines, and a line in the Sicilian Defense attracted his attention. He liked a novelty and decided to use it in an important game without even checking it. However, it turned out that the line was faulty.
Since then, the grandmaster has never used opening lines in important games without thoroughly checking them first.
No. 41
I. Zilber – M. Tal
1958, Riga, Latvian Championship, round 10
The other loss, to Zilber, is also very characteristic of Tal.
The diagram shows a complicated position with roughly equal chances. By playing 13...a6, black could have counted on some counterplay with b7-b5.
Editor’s note:
The position on the diagram occurred in many subsequent games. Black most often played 13...Be6 and usually met 14.Nxe6 with 14...Rxe6, planning to create pressure on the e4 pawn with Ra8-e8, for instance: 15.f4 Ned7 16.Bf2 Rae8 17.Qc2 Nh5 18.Rad1 Nc5 (Volzhin — J. Piket, Ohrid, 2001).
Koblenz’s recommendation 13...a6 is not good, because it’s almost impossible to create good conditions for b7-b5. For instance, in the game Ris — Bosch (Netherlands 2014), there followed 14.Rad1 c5 (after 14...b5?, there’s 15.cxb5, and the position is bad for black after both 15...axb5 16.f4 Nc4 17.Nxc6 and 15...cxb5 16.f4 Nc4 17.e5) 15.Nb3 Qb4? (black had to accept a difficult position after 15...Qc7 16.f4 Nc6) 16.Rxd6+–.
But Tal instead decides to sacrifice a piece.
13...Qb4 14.f4 Nxc4 15.a3 Qc5 16.b4 Qh5 17.Qxc4 Bxh3 18.Bf2 d5
Editor’s note:
The game move quickly loses, however, black didn’t have enough compensation in any case.
19.exd5 Bxg2 20.Kxg2 cxd5 21.Qd3 Rxe1 22.Rxe1 Ng4
Black had placed all his hopes in this position. Tal thought that white had to play 23.Nf3, and prepared 23...Qh3+! 24.Kg1 Qh1+! 25.Kxh1 Nxf2+ and 26...Nxd3.
However, Zilber played
23.Bg1!
This prosaic bishop retreat refutes black’s combination.
Black resigned
on move 54.
This prompts the question: perhaps, when playing a direct competitor, it’s better to avoid risky continuations and quietly wait for events to unfold?
Such decisions depend on the player’s personality. If the player is bold and is not afraid to take risks, he has to follow his heart, even in the most important games.
In June, Tal traveled to Crimea for a holiday. We gradually started preparing for the Interzonal. Then one day we got a phone call. A Soviet Chess Federation representative told us that Tal had been called up to the students’ national team, and he should head to Bulgaria.
Tal said goodbye to his new Crimean friends. As he boarded the plane to Varna, he felt like the happiest man alive...
The Soviet student team leader, Misha achieved a great result – 8.5/10.
On the Adriatic Sea
A few weeks after the student Olympiad, the Interzonal tournament opened in the Yugoslavian resort of Portoroz. This was an event eagerly awaited by chess players in all countries.
Previously, Tal had only played in international team events. Now, however, he had to play in a qualifying tournament for the world championship title.
Portoroz – a quiet town with five hotels and a few bars – completely transformed itself in those days. Flags of the countries whose representatives played in the tournament were displayed on the buildings facing the sea, while shop windows dazzled passers-by with bright posters and photos of the players. The grandmasters and masters fell victim to the autograph hunters. They were pestered everywhere – on the streets, in restaurants, even on the beach.
Tal defeated the Colombian player De Greiff in the first round and faced the renowned Hungarian grandmaster Laszlo Szabo in the second. Szabo played an unassuming opening and offered a draw on move 12. Tal declined the draw, and the battle intensified.
No. 42
L. Szabo – M. Tal
1958, Portoroz, Interzonal Tournament, round 2
23...Kh7!
Editor’s note:
The purpose of this prophylactic move will become clear three moves later.
24.h3 a6
Editor’s note:
Black is planning Nc6-a7-b5, attacking the weak c3 pawn.
25.Qb6 Ne7 26.Qd6 Qe8!
Editor’s note:
If the black king were on g8 right now, white would have captured the e6 pawn with check. Now, however, 27.Qxe6?? is met with 27...R7c6, trapping the queen.
27.Rb6 R4c6 28.Rxc6 Qxc6 29.Rb1 Rd7
Black’s intentions are clear – he wants to drive the opponent’s queen away from its active position.
30.Qb4
White avoids the queen trade, because after 30.Qxc6 Nxc6, black threatened Na7-b5 and Rc7-c4.
30...Nc8 31.g4 g6 32.Qf8 Rg7 33.Kf2 Qc4! 34.Rb2
Editor’s note:
The correct move was 34.gxf5. Black can’t play 34...gxf5, because after 35.Rg1! Rxg1 36.Kxg1 he even loses due to the threats Qf8–f7+ and Bd2–e1–h4. Meanwhile, after 34...exf5, the e5 pawn becomes passed, which gives white enough counterchances. The following line is possible, for instance: 35.Ke3 Na7 36.Qb4 Qc7 (36...Qxb4? 37.Rxb4 Nc6 38.c4!! Nxb4 39.Bxb4 dxc4 40.d5+–) 37.c4 dxc4 38.d5 g5 39.Qb6 Qd7 40.Qxa7 Qxd5 41.Qd4 gxf4+ 42.Qxf4 Rg2 43.Qxf5+ Kg7 44.Be1 Rg5 45.Qf6+ Kg8 46.Rd1 Rxe5+ (or 46...Qxd1 47.Qe6+, and the king can’t hide from the pursuit) 47.Kf2 Rf5+ 48.Kg1 Rg5+ 49.Kf2 Qg2+ 50.Ke3 Qxh3+ 51.Ke2 Qh5+ 52.Ke3, and black only has perpetual check.
34...Na7
35.Rb6
Editor’s note:
It was necessary to go for the endgame with 35.Qc5 (perhaps after trading on f5 first) 35...Qxc5 36.dxc5, and even though white is clearly worse, he still has some chances to save the game.
35...Nc6 36.Ke1 Qd3! 37.g5 hxg5 38.fxg5 Nxa5 39.Rxe6 Nc4 40.Bc1 Qxc3+
41.Kd1
There was an opinion that white could put up more resistance with 41.Ke2. However, this could be met with 41...Qxc1 42.Re8 Qe3+ 43.Kf1 Nd2+ 44.Kg2 Qxg5+ 45.Kh1 Kh6.
41...Qxd4+ 42.Ke2 Qe4+ 43.Kd1 Qf3+ 44.Kc2 Qe2+ 45.Kc3 d4+ 46.Kb4 a5+ 47.Kc5 Rc7+ 48.Kb5 Nxe5+ 49.Kb6 Rc6+ White resigned.
The third round game Tal – Pachman was aptly described by grandmaster Svetozar Gligoric:
“After every knockdown punch, Pachman would get up before the referee reached the count of ten. His opponent had to start anew each time, until he, too, was out of strength.”
The opponents agreed to a draw in a rook ending on move 50.
Intense emotions awaited Tal in the fourth round. His game against Aleksandar Matanovic was adjourned in the following position:
No. 43
A. Matanovic – M. Tal
1958, Portoroz, Interzonal Tournament, round 4
We thought that Matanovic had sealed the move 41.bxa4. It was objectively the strongest one. A long search for any way to save the game gave us nothing – the position was lost. There was no time to study other continuations in detail.
However, at the resumption we discovered that our opponent had sealed a weaker move,
41.b4
Editor’s note:
It seems that the game move is also enough for a win.
41...Ne3 42.Re6!
But not 42.Kc3 due to 42...a3 43.b5 Nd1+ 44.Kd4 Bb7.
Editor’s note:
Koblenz’s line requires some corrections. Instead of 44.Kd4??, the right move is 44.Kb4, and white wins. So it’s necessary to change the move order to 42...Nd1+! (instead of the erroneous 42...a3) 43.Kd4 a3!, and after 44.Kxe4 (but not 44.b5?? Bb7, and the position from Koblenz’s note occurs, which is won for black) 44...a2 45.b5 a1=Q 46.Ra6+ Qxa6 47.bxa6 Kxa6 it’s a draw.
42...Nxc4+ 43.Kc3 Bd5 44.Rxg6 Nb6 45.h4 a3 46.b5
Editor’s note:
This move is a mistake that could have cost Matanovic half a point, whereas the h-pawn advance could have decided the game in just a few moves: 46.h5 Bf7 47.Rg5 (but not 47.Rg7? Na4+ 48.Kc2 a2 49.Rg1 Bxh5 50.Kb3 Nb6 51.Kxa2 Nd5=) 47...Na4+ 48.Kd4 Kb6 (48...a2 49.Ra5++–) 49.h6 a2 50.Rg1 Bg8 51.Ra1+–.
46...Bf7 47.Rg1
Here Tal thought for a while and... made a losing move.
“I was thinking about the line 47.Rg7 Na4+ 48.Kc2 a2,” he said after the game. “I liked this pawn spurt so much that I automatically grabbed the pawn after my opponent’s move. And so, I had to make this horrible move. After 47.Rg1, I planned to play 47...Nd5+ 48.Kb3 Kb6, with good drawing chances.”
After
47...a2?, the Yugoslavian grandmaster won.
Tal’s next opponent was the Czechoslovakian grandmaster Miroslav Filip. I knew that, after a loss, Tal would surely try and bounce back with a win, so I feared that in the game against such a careful, mature player as Filip, the desire to force matters at any cost may lead to a catastrophe.
No. 44
M. Tal – M. Filip
1958, Portoroz, Interzonal Tournament, round 5
While Tal was thinking over his position, Petrosian’s second, grandmaster Efim Geller, leaned in to me and said, “It seems that Misha can’t do much this time!”
I realized that it wasn’t easy to explode black’s solid position, but I wanted to object in some way, so I answered Geller, “If Misha has an open line, there’ll be a mate!”
At that moment, white sacrificed a bishop on h6.
28.Bxh6!
“After this move,” Matanovic wrote, “white could have faced some problems, but we can’t deny that he only won because of this sacrifice. We should respect his boldness!”
Editor’s note:
Actually, even the computer agrees that Tal’s bishop sacrifice was the strongest move. Other continuations are much weaker: 28.Bc1?? Rxd1 29.Rxd1 Nxe4–+
or 28.Be3? Rxd1 29.Rxd1 (29.Bxd1 Bxe3 30.Qxe3 Rd3–+) 29...Bxe3 30.Qxe3 Nh5, with the subsequent Nh5-f4 and an overwhelming position.
28.Bxh6! gxh6 29.Qxe5 Be7 30.Rd4 Rxd4 31.cxd4 Kh7 32.Rd1 Ne8?
It was better to play 32...Qg7!, and if 33.Qxe7, then 33...Rg8.
Actually, Tal planned to meet 32...Qg7 with 33.Qf4 Rg8 34.Qf3, with roughly equal chances.
33.f6!
The bishop joins the attack, and black’s position quickly deteriorates.
Editor’s note:
Actually, black could have saved the game here had he played 33...Bxf6 — after the subsequent 34.Qf5+ Kg8 (34...Kh8? 35.e5+–) 35.Rg1+ (or 35.e5 Qe7 36.Qh7+ Kf8 37.Rg1 Qe6 38.Rg8+ Ke7 39.Qxh6 Qd5+ 40.Kg1 Bg7 41.Qg5+ Kd7 42.Bf5+ Kc7 43.Qe7+ Kb6 44.Rxe8 Rxe8 45.Qxe8 Qxd4 46.Qxf7 Bxe5 with a drawn endgame) 35...Bg7 36.e5 Qb4 37.e6 fxe6 38.Qxe6+ Kf8 39.Qf5+ Ke7 40.Qe4+ Kf7, white only has perpetual check.
33...Nxf6 34.Qf5+ Kh8 35.e5 Qg7 36.exf6 Bxf6 37.Rg1 Bg5 38.f4 Black resigned.
In the following rounds, Tal had to settle for a draw three times. Especially frustrating was losing half a point against the Filipino player Cardoso, who was last in the tournament at that point.
Against Gligoric, Tal managed to draw the game with ingenious and inventive defense, while in the game with international master Oleg Neikirch, Tal didn’t dare to decline the draw offer in a slightly worse position.
The peacefulness of the calm, always smiling master from Sofia was boundless.
“I can’t play against a fifteen year-old boy. If I win, people in Sofia will say that I bullied the kid. And if I lose, I’d be ashamed to return to Bulgaria” – that’s how Neikirch explained his draw against Bobby Fischer.
Master Geza Fuster performed quite badly in the tournament. In time trouble, he would lose drawn or even clearly won games.
The loss to Tal upset him the least of all of his defeats.
No. 45
M. Tal – G. Fuster

17.Bxe6! fxe5 18.dxe5 Be7 19.Rhf1! Rf8 20.Rxf8+ Bxf8 21.Qf3
21...Qe7
Alekhine once said, “Such a pity that the execution of a beautiful plan always depends on your opponent as well!”
Here, Tal expected 21...Bc5 and had prepared 22.b4 Bxb4 23.Rd7 Qxd7 24.Bxd7+ Kxd7 25.Qb3 a5 26.a3 Bg8 27.Qb2, and black doesn’t get enough compensation for the queen.
22.Qb3
With 22.Bd7+ Qxd7 23.Rxd7 Kxd7 24.Qf7+ Be7 25.Qxg7, white could transition into a won endgame, but Tal decided to set a trap for his opponent.
22...Rb8? 23.Bd7+ Qxd7 24.Rxd7 Kxd7 25.Qf7+ Be7 26.e6+ Kd8
After 26...Kd6, there follows, of course, 27.Qf4+.
27.Qxg7 Black resigned.
After this win, Tal advanced to second place. The leader of the tournament, Tigran Petrosian, had a half-point more.
“Where did I make a mistake?” the Argentinian master Rossetto asked Tal after their game.
It was hard to answer this question. For a time, it seemed that Tal wanted to win so much that he lost the ability to assess the position objectively. At any rate, declining a draw offer while a pawn down really looked reckless.
“Without a doubt, the analysts will find where Rossetto could have played better, which move would have caused the most trouble for his inventive opponent, but this won’t render the young Soviet champion’s victory any less valuable,” grandmasters Gligoric and Matanovic wrote in the tournament book.

Editor’s note:
The main line here is 10...Rb8, intending b7-b5.

In times past, when the leading grandmasters were much stronger than masters, the tournament leader usually didn’t have a hard time against weaker players. The player with the higher title would usually get an advantage out of the opening.
In our days, the leaders have a much harder time: opponents from the lower half of the table sometimes put up very stiff resistance against the favorites.
Some grandmasters try to defeat the weaker players with a sit-and-wait strategy. They expect their opponent to make a subtle positional mistake at some point. In tournaments with “mixed” line-ups, such tactics allow them to compete for high places. High places, but not first place. To finish first, pure technique is usually not enough. Only a brave tournament fighter who’s not afraid to face dangers can compete for first place. That’s how Tal and Korchnoi play. Even in games against weaker opponents, they face danger without fear. Of course, such a playing style requires great strength and expense of energy.
13.Bf4 b4 14.Nd1 Re8 15.Re1 c4 16.Qc2 Ra7 17.Be3 Rae7
18.Nd2
White allows his opponent to launch a queenside operation. He’s hoping for the chance to disperse and eliminate the advance party that has ventured too far ahead of the main forces.
In this critical moment, Tal finds an interesting tactical resource.
18...b3!
Editor’s note:
The computer likes 18...Bd7!? more, planning Bd7-b5, not ceding the c3 square to white and retaining the possibility of playing c4-c3 in a number of lines. After the subsequent 19.Nxc4 Qc7 20.Rc1 Nxe4 21.Nb6 Nc5 22.Nxd7 Qxd7, the position is roughly equal.
19.axb3
Editor’s note:
19.Qc1!? was worthy of serious consideration, planning Nd1-c3 and not allowing his opponent the opportunity to carry out the tactical blow that happened on move 20. In this case, it’s hard for black to find ways to develop a good initiative, while white’s space and pawn advantage in the center might help him.
19...Nxb3 20.Ra4
20.Nxb3 cxb3 21.Qxb3 Nxe4 is better for black.
20...Nxd5! 21.exd5 Bf5 22.Qxc4 Nxd2 23.Qxa6
Black has seized the initiative after sacrificing a pawn, but the crucial events are still ahead.
23...Ne4 24.Qb6 Qc8
Tal decides not to trade queens: he needs his queen for a kingside attack.
25.g4 Nc5 26.Ra7
Editor’s note:
Perhaps 26.Ra3!? was stronger – after the subsequent 26...Bc2 (26...Nd3? 27.Rf1+–) 27.Qxd6 Nd3 28.Rf1, black must prove that his activity compensates for the lack of two pawns.
26...Rxa7 27.Qxa7 Nd3 28.Rf1 Be4 29.Qa3 Bxg2 30.Kxg2 Qc4! 31.Qxd6 Bf8 32.Qc6 Qe4+ 33.Kg1
Here, white could have saved the game with 33.f3 Qe5 34.d6 Bxd6 35.f4. But Rossetto already had too little time: his flag was hanging menacingly.
Editor’s note:
The game move actually doesn’t lose either.
33...Ne5 34.Nc3 Nf3+ 35.Kh1 Qe5 36.Kg2 Nh4+ 37.Kg1 Bd6 38.Rd1
Editor’s note:
White could have salvaged the game with 38.Bf4!, for instance, 38...Qxf4 (38...Nf3+ 39.Kg2 Qxf4 40.Qxe8+ Kg7 41.Rd1 Ne5 42.Kf1 Bc5 43.Rd2 doesn’t win either) 39.Qxe8+ Kg7 40.Rd1 Bc5 (after 40...Qf3?! 41.Kf1 Qxh3+ 42.Ke2 Qxg4+ 43.Kd3 the white king escapes the pursuit, and white retains all the extra material) 41.Ne4 Qf3 42.Qe5+ Kg8 (after 42...f6? 43.Qxf6+, only black can lose) 43.Nf6+ Kf8 44.Nd7+ with perpetual check.
38...Qh2+ 39.Kf1 Rxe3 White resigned.
Until round 14, Tal shadowed Tigran Petrosian, staying half a point behind the leader. In round 15, he caught up with the Moscow grandmaster, and on the next day, they switched places – Tal took the lead.
In round 17, Petrosian played Sanguinetti. After losing in the previous round, the grandmaster looked tired, but he played very coolly, gradually increasing his positional advantage.
Tal played against the Argentinian grandmaster Oscar Panno. At first, Tal watched his rival’s game carefully, but then the events of his own game had him in deep thought.
Panno, usually a quiet player, was unrecognizable in this game. He chose an original defensive system, creating a real storm on the board.
The game was still on, but I was already receiving consolations.
David Bronstein approached me first.
“Don’t be upset if Misha loses today,” he whispered to me. “You’ll see, he’ll bounce back for sure!”
“Panno has a whole bunch of pieces for his queen!” Vladimir Simagin, Yuri Averbakh’s coach, sighed.
“Could you tell me where Tal made a mistake?” a Yugoslavian journalist asked me as he passed by. “I’m sorry, I’m hurrying to the telegraph. Panno will win for sure, and there’ll be a long queue later...”
What happened in that game, anyway?
No. 47, Ruy Lopez
M. Tal – O. Panno
1958, Portoroz, Interzonal Tournament, round 17
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 0-0 9.h3 Nd7
Editor’s note:
In modern practice, there are much more popular moves for black: 9...Na5, 9...Bb7 and 9...Nb8 (with the idea of Nb8-d7 and Bc8-b7).
10.d4 Nb6
Editor’s note:
In subsequent games, black usually played 10...Bf6 in this line.
11.Be3
Editor’s note:
The current main line in this position is 11.Nbd2.
11...exd4 12.cxd4 Na5 13.Bc2 c5
14.e5!
White has to play energetically, otherwise black will seize the initiative, for instance, after the quiet 14.Nc3 Nac4 15.Bc1 cxd4 16.Nxd4 Bf6.
Editor’s note:
The computer evaluates the situation differently: it says that white is slightly better in Koblenz’s line (the weakness on d6 is rather glaring, and the active c4 knight can be kicked away with b2-b3), while the game move leads to a roughly equal position.
14...dxe5!
The Argentinian player avoids the trap 14...Nac4 15.exd6 Qxd6, which Tal planned to meet with 16.Bg5!.
Editor’s note:
The position from Koblenz’s line is not dangerous for black: after the subsequent 16...Bxg5 17.Nxg5 h6 18.dxc5 Qxd1 (18...Qxc5? 19.Nh7! Nxb2 20.Qe2 drops an exchange, because black can’t play 20...Rd8 due to 21.Qe8+) 19.Bxd1 (19.Rxd1?! Nxb2) 19...hxg5 (black is all right after 19...Nd7 or 19...Nxb2) 20.cxb6 (or 20.b3 Bb7=) 20...Nxb2, the position is equal. However, instead of 15.exd6, white has a stronger reply 15.Qd3, and after 15...g6 16.exd6 Bxd6 (perhaps 16...Qxd6 is the lesser evil, even though it loses a pawn after 17.dxc5 Qxd3 18.Bxd3) 17.Bg5, white has a very dangerous initiative.
15.Nxe5 Nbc4 16.Qd3
Declining the draw — 16.Qh5 g6 17.Nxg6 fxg6 18.Bxg6 hxg6 19.Qxg6+ Kh8 – and willingly diving into complications that are hard to calculate completely.
16...f5
Editor’s note:
16...g6, intending Bc8-f5, was worthy of serious consideration.
17.Bb3! f4
Editor’s note:
This move is a mistake. Instead of it, Panno had a number of good resources, including the immediate 17...Nxb3, for instance: 18.Nc6 (or 18.Qxb3 Be6, and 19.dxc5 is bad due to 19...f4 with the subsequent 20...Bxc5) 18...Qd6 19.Nxe7+ Qxe7 20.axb3 Nxe3 21.Rxe3 Qg5, and black is no worse (22.dxc5? f4).
18.Bd2 Nxb3!
A great reply! After 19.Qxb3 Bf6 20.Nxc4 bxc4 21.Qxc4+ Kh8, white faces considerable trouble, while in the line that happened in the game, black gets more than enough compensation for the queen.
Editor’s note:
In Koblenz’s line, instead of the erroneous 20.Nxc4, white has a stronger reply 20.Na3, and analysis shows that after the subsequent 20...Be6 21.Naxc4, the position is equal.
19.Nc6 Nxa1 20.Nxd8 Bf5 21.Qf3 Raxd8 22.Rxe7 Bxb1 23.Bxf4
Editor’s note:
23.Be1! was a much stronger move, with black facing great difficulties due to his uncoordinated pieces, for instance: 23...Nc2 24.Qg4 Rf7 25.Qe6 Rdf8 26.Rxf7 Rxf7 27.dxc5, and, because of the dangerous passed c-pawn and weak a6 pawn (and if it falls, the b5 pawn will likely fall as well), black might not hold, or 23...cxd4 24.b3 Rfe8 25.Bb4 Ne5 26.Qb7 Rxe7 27.Qxe7 Nf7 28.Ba5 Rf8 29.Qe1 Bxa2 30.Qxa1 Bxb3 31.Qxd4 Ng5 32.Bb4 Re8 33.Qxf4 — white has a material advantage now, and it’s black who has to struggle for a draw.
23...Rxd4
In the opinion of the Yugoslavian theoretician V. Vukovic, black should have won after 23...cxd4, however, after 24.b3 Bg6 25.bxc4 d3 (threatening 26...Rxf4), white has the move 26.Qg4, and if 26...d2, then 27.Rd7 (
Editor’s note:
The computer insists on 27.Bxd2! Rxd2 28.c5 instead and proves that the passed c-pawn wins the game for white). After 26...Rxf4, there’s 27.Qxf4 d2 28.Rxg7+! Kh8 29.Rd7!, and white wins.
Editor’s note:
In the above line, instead of 26.Qg4, white has an even stronger move: 26.Qg3! d2 27.Bxd2! Rxd2 28.Qc3 Rd1+ 29.Kh2 Bf7 30.c5+–. But, at any rate, instead of the erroneous 24...Bg6, the correct move is 24...Nd6, for instance: 25.Re1 Be4 26.Qg3 Nc2 27.Bxd6 Nxe1 28.Bxf8 Rxf8 29.Qe5 Bxg2 30.Qxe1 Bxh3 31.Qe4 Rf6 (31...Rd8? 32.Qh4) 32.Qxd4 h6 with an obvious draw. But instead of 24.b3, white has an interesting resource 24.Qg3!? – after the subsequent 24...Bg6 25.b3 Nb6 26.Be5 Rd7 27.Rxd7 Nxd7 28.Bxd4 Nc2 29.Bb2 black can be satisfied from the material point of view, but the white pieces are very active, the g7 square needs protection, the c2 knight is placed very awkwardly, and the a6 pawn is very weak and will likely fall soon, so it’s only white who can play for a win here.
24.Qg4! Bg6 25.Qe6+ Bf7 26.Qf5 Nc2
The knight is stuck deep behind enemy lines and has to be brought back into play. After 26...Bg6, Tal intended to play 27.Rxg7+ Kxg7 28.Bh6+ Kxh6 29.Qxf8+ with the subsequent 30.Qxc5+ and Qxd4.
Editor’s note:
The game move wasn’t the only move; another good reply was 26...Rd5 27.Qe4 (27.Qb1?! Bg6 28.Qe1 Nc2 29.Qe6+ Bf7 30.Qxa6 Rd1+ 31.Kh2 Nd4 gives black dangerous counterplay and is risky for white) 27...Rd4 28.Qf5 Rd5, with repetition.
27.b3 Bg6
Editor’s note:
This move is a mistake. The correct reply was 27...Rd1+ 28.Kh2 Nd2 – analysis shows that the position is dynamically equal: 29.Bxd2 Rxd2 30.Qxc5, and then, for instance, 30...h6 (a useful luft) 31.Ra7 Re8 32.Rxa6 Nd4 33.Ra7 Ree2 34.Qc8+ Re8 35.Qc3 Ree2 36.Qc8+ Re8, with repetition.
28.Rxg7+
This sacrifice doesn’t win. However, black has to be very careful to repel the numerous threats.
Editor’s note:
Actually, black is already lost.
28...Kxg7 29.Bh6+ Kxh6 30.Qxf8+ Kg5 31.bxc4 bxc4 32.g3
Editor’s note:
This is a mistake. White could have won with both 32.g4, intending Kg1-h2-g3, and 32.Kh2, with the idea g3-g4 and Kh2-g3. For instance: 32.g4 Rd7 33.Kh2 Rf7 34.Qd6 Kh6 (34...Rxf2+ 35.Kg3 Rf7 36.Qe5+ Kh6 37.Kh4+–) 35.Qxc5 Kg7 36.Qe5+ Kg8 37.f4 Bd3 38.Qg5+ Kf8 39.Qd8+ Kg7 40.Qd6 a5 41.a4 Nb4 42.f5 – white will soon capture the a5 pawn and win the game with a combined pawn push on both flanks.
32...Be4 33.h4+ Kg4 34.Kh2 Bf5!
Had black retreated his bishop with 34...Bd5, he would have gotten checkmated after 35.f3+! Bxf3 36.Qc8+ Kh5 37.Qf5+.
There were only a few minutes left until time control, but Tal was in deep thought.
“Why is he thinking?” the spectators murmured. He seemed to have only one move: 35.f3+. But Tal played a different move.
35.Qf6!
After 35.f3+? Kxf3 36.Qxf5+ Ke3 37.Qxh7 c3, it’s white who has to scramble for a draw now!
Editor’s note:
Analysis leaves no doubt that the position resulting from Koblenz’s line is indeed won for black.
35...h6 36.Qe5 Re4 37.Qg7+ Kf3 38.Qc3+ Ne3
With 38...Kxf2 39.Qxc2+ Kf3, black could have easily drawn. At this moment, both players were completely exhausted. Drops of sweat ran down Panno’s face. And, as the reader can see, there was a reason for this exhaustion!
39.Kg1! Bg4 40.fxe3 h5 41.Qe1!
41...Rxe3
The decisive mistake. Black could have drawn with 41...Re6!. (
Editor’s note:
One of the possible lines after 41...Re6! is, for instance: 42.e4 c3 43.Qxc3+ Kxe4 44.Qxc5 Kd3, and, no matter what the computer says, there’s a fortress on the board.)
The game was adjourned here. Here’s how it ended on the resumption day:
42.Qf1+ Ke4 43.Qxc4+ Kf3 44.Qf1+ Ke4 45.Qxa6 Kd4 46.Qd6+ Kc4 47.a4 Re1+ 48.Kf2 Re2+ 49.Kf1 Ra2 50.Qa6+ Kd4 51.a5 c4 52.Qb6+ Kd5 53.a6 Ra1+ 54.Kf2 c3 55.a7 c2 56.Qb3+ Kd6 57.Qd3+
, and
black resigned
, because he can’t take the a7 pawn without losing his rook.
This game shows just how energetic and inspired Tal’s play was in double-edged positions.
While Tal’s theoretical knowledge, endgame technique and persistence in defense are not superior to that of other leading grandmasters, his dynamic style, rich imagination and quickness of calculation undoubtedly make him stand out even among the most renowned chess players.
Tal is able to create more and more difficulties for his opponents. Sometimes, his opponent manages to repel a whole series of attacks and avoids numerous traps, but difficult defense exhausts him so much that he ultimately makes a mistake.
For the spectators who sit comfortably in their tournament hall chairs, this mistake may seem random and inexplicable... In actuality, this is a consequence of the great strain.
Tal drew his last three games in Portoroz. He took first place, earning the right to continue his quest for the world championship title.
The Absolutely Best Result
At the 13th Chess Olympiad in Munich, the Soviet Union team emerged victorious again, winning the world champions’ cup.
Mikhail Tal was the first reserve player, but he played 15 games. His result, 13.5/15, was the best individual result at the whole Olympiad.
Before the match with England, a journalist asked Tal which combination at the Olympiad he considered his best.
“I hope to play one soon,” Tal joked.
It’s up to the reader to decide whether this hope came true.
No. 48, Caro-Kann Defense
M. Tal – H. Golombek
1958, Munich, 13th Olympiad Final, round 8
1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 Bf5 4.c4
4...e6
Black is right to decline this pawn sacrifice. After 4...Bxb1 5.Rxb1 Qa5+ 6.Bd2 Qxa2 7.c5! b5 8.Ra1 Qxb2 9.Ne2 b4 10.Qa4 b3 11.Nc1! it’s quite hard to repel the threat 12.Bd3 with the subsequent Rb1.
Editor’s note:
In addition to 12.Bd3, white has other threats: 12.Ra3 (with the subsequent Rxb3) and even 12.Bb5. The computer leaves no doubt about Koblenz’s evaluation of the final position: white wins.
5.Nc3 dxc4 6.Bxc4 Ne7 7.Nge2 Nd7 8.0-0 Nb6 9.Bb3 Qd7
9...Ned5 with the subsequent Be7, completing development, was worth considering.
10.a4 a5 11.Ng3
Editor’s note:
In a modern grandmaster game Stukopin – Maceija (Greensboro 2015), white preferred 11.Be3 with unclear play.
11...Bg6
12.Bc2!
A subtle positional maneuver. After the bishop trade, the black king loses an important defender; in addition, the white knight can reach the important e4 square.
12...Bxc2 13.Qxc2 Ned5
The central pawn shouldn’t be captured. After 13...Qxd4 14.Be3 Qd8 15.Nce4 Ned5 16.Bc5!, white’s attack is unstoppable.
Editor’s note:
Koblenz’s evaluation is not confirmed by analysis: after the subsequent 16...Nb4 17.Qc3 N6d5 18.Qc4, black doesn’t even have to offer a draw by repetition with 18...Nb6 (which white should probably agree to): he can even try to prove that his extra pawn is worth more than his opponent’s activity, for instance: 18...Bxc5 19.Qxc5 b6 20.Nd6+ Kd7 with the subsequent 21...Qe7 — his strong knight on d5 hinders the development of his opponent’s initiative. One of the possible improvements for white in this line is 15.f4 (with the idea of f4-f5), and there are other possibilities as well.
14.Nce4 Nb4 15.Qe2 N6d5 16.f4! g6 17.Ra3 Be7 18.Bd2 Nc2 19.Rd3 Ndb4 20.Bxb4 Nxb4 21.Rdd1 Rd8 22.Kh1 h5 23.Nf6+
Editor’s note:
The last move is a mistake that could have led to a very dubious position for white. A better move was, for instance, 23.Rf3 (with the idea of activating the g3 knight with Ng3-f1-e3), with roughly equal chances.
23...Bxf6 24.exf6 Kf8
24...0-0 didn’t work due to 25.Nxh5!
Editor’s note:
Black had a much stronger move 24...h4 25.Ne4 Qc7, with the idea Ke8-d7-c8. In this case, white has no dangerous initiative, and his pawn weaknesses are rather obvious.
25.Ne4 h4
It was better to involve the knight in defense with 25...Nd5.
Editor’s note:
It’s quite possible that the game move, which gives black an opportunity to get the rook into the game with Rh8-h5 in many lines and also creates the idea h4-h3, was indeed the strongest.
26.Nc5
Editor’s note:
26.Rf3 was a stronger reply, activating the rook on the third rank (with resources such as Rf3-h3 or Rf3-c3-c5) and maintaining the possibility of Ng3-e4-g5, which counters both the possible activation of the h8 rook and h4-h3.
26...Qc8
27.f5! gxf5
Editor’s note:
After 27...exf5! 28.Qe7+ Kg8 29.Qxb7 Nd5 30.Rfe1 h3 31.Qxc8 hxg2+ 32.Kxg2 Rxc8 33.Nd7 Rc7 34.Ne5 Nxf6 35.Rc1 Kg7 36.Rxc6 Rb7 37.Re2 Nd5, black gets an endgame with a clear advantage because of his dangerous kingside pawns and white’s pawn weaknesses.
28.Qe3! b6
Editor’s note:
A blunder that loses the game. After 28...Nd5 (preventing Rf4) 29.Qg5 Rh7, with the idea of Rd6 and Qd8 (with the possible inclusion of b6), the game is unclear.
29.Qg5 Rh7 30.Rf4! bxc5 31.Rxh4 Rxh4 32.Qg7+ Ke8 33.Qg8+ Kd7 34.Qxf7+ Kd6 35.Qe7+ Black resigned.
Casual chess lovers are usually enchanted by the amount of sacrificed material. More knowledgeable fans can also appreciate a subtle sacrifice of a pawn – a humble footman of the chess army.
A pawn sacrifice often serves as a signal for the attack – the spark that creates the fire for the onslaught.
No. 49
A. Beni – M. Tal
1958, Munich, 13th Olympiad Preliminaries, round 2
Black could have just completed development with 14...b6 and Bb7, but this plan gave white great freedom of action. To seize the initiative (to develop the light-squared bishop and create a base on d5), Tal sacrifices a pawn.
14...b5! 15.cxb5 Bb7
Editor’s note:
15...Nxd3 16.Qxd3 a6! led to a big advantage.
16.Bc4
(16...
N
xf3+ was a threat)
16...Nd5 17.Qd2 Nb6 18.Be2 Qc7
Editor’s note:
The best move here is probably 18...Nxe2+! 19.Qxe2 a6, with a dangerous initiative and clear compensation for the sacrificed pawn.
19.Nxd4 cxd4
A dangerous passed pawn replaces the knight.
20.Bd3 Nd5 21.a3 a6
If now 22.bxa6 Bxa6 23.Bxa6 Rxa6 24.Kh1, then 24...Qc4, and, due to the threat 25...Rfc8 and Nb4, it’s hard for white to contain black’s pressure in the center and on the queenside.
Editor’s note:
In Koblenz’s line, instead of 24...Qc4, there’s a stronger move 24...Rc6!, and black wins because of the idea Rc6-c2. However, instead of 24.Kh1?, white has 24.Qd3, and if 24...Rc6, then 25.Bd2 – black has decent compensation, but it doesn’t give him any advantage. So white did have to play 22.bxa6, whereas after the game move his position quickly unravels.
22.Qe2 axb5 23.Bxb5 Qb6 24.Kh1 Nb4 25.a4 d3
Editor’s note:
There was no need to hurry with this move. Black had a great opportunity 25...Rac8 with a strong initiative that ensured a big advantage. After the game move 25...d3, on the other hand, white could play 26.Qf2!, and the position becomes unclear (after 26...Bc5, there’s 27.Be3).
26.Qg4? Nc2 27.Rb1 Rfd8 28.Bd2 Qd4
Editor’s note:
This move could have lost all the advantage. A better alternative was 28...Nd4!, for instance, 29.Be3 (29.Nc3 can be met with 29...Nf5!, intending 30...Nh4) 29...d2!, and white’s position is difficult (30.Bxd2?? loses immediately to 30...Nxb5).
29.Bc3
Editor’s note:
White shouldn’t have called off the blockade of the d3 pawn. After 29.Qh3, with the ideas Nd1-c3, Nd1-f2 and f4-f5, the position is unclear (and completely equal from the computer’s point of view).
29...Qd5
Editor’s note:
A much better move was 29...Qe4 30.Nf2 (30.Bd2? Qe2!–+) 30...Qe2! 31.Qxe2 dxe2 32.Bxe2 Ne3 33.Rg1 Rxa4 with strong pressure.
White now had to return his bishop to d2 on his next move, getting good chances to hold, but he makes a decisive mistake instead.
30.Rf3 d2 31.f5
A desperate attempt to complicate play.
31...exf5 32.Qxf5 Ne1! 33.Rg3 Nxg2 34.Kg1 Bc5+ 35.Kf1 Nf4! 36.Rxg7+ Kf8 37.Qxf4 Qh1+ 38.Ke2 Qe1#
Petrosian’s Victory
The 26th Soviet championship was held in Tbilisi.
In the first half of the tournament, Tal lost to Yakov Yukhtman and Eduard Gufeld, but then won nine games, which almost allowed him to catch up with the leader. He trailed Tigran Petrosian by a point.
Tal won an interesting game in round 17.

Elite players today usually castle long here.

Editor’s note:
The current main line in this position is 11.Rad1.
11...Ne5 12.Bb3
Editor’s note:
12.Be2? is bad due to 12...Nxe4!, winning a pawn.
12...g5 13.Bg3 Bd7
Editor’s note:
Black’s position is also fine after 13...Nh5!, forcing the trade of his opponent’s dark-squared bishop: Firat – Sakaev (Rijeka 2010) and Padmini – Kotanjian (Manila 2010).
14.f4 gxf4 15.Bxf4 Qc7! 16.Nf3 0-0-0 17.Kh1 Rhg8 18.Be3 Bc6 19.Qd4 Rg6 20.Re2 Rdg8 21.Qa7
Black’s pieces have assumed threatening positions, and Nikitin wants to trade queens to weaken his opponent’s onslaught. But he’s in for a big surprise.
21...Nxe4
This leads to a tempest of complications, which ultimately result in black’s decisive advantage in the endgame.
Editor’s note:
Actually, Tal’s move could have led to big trouble had white played 22.Nxe4, for instance: 22...Bxe4 23.Bb6 Nc6 (23...Bxf3? 24.Bxc7 Rxg2 25.Rxf3 Rg1+ 26.Qxg1 Rxg1+ 27.Kxg1 Nxf3+ 28.Kf2 Nd4 29.Bb6 Nxe2 30.Kxe2+–) 24.Qa8+ Kd7 25.Qxg8 Rxg8 26.Bxc7 Bxf3 27.Rxf3 Nd4 (27...Kxc7? 28.Rxf7+–) 28.Rff2 Nxe2 29.Bb6! Nc1 30.Ba4+ Kc8 31.Rxf7 Rf8 32.Rxe7 Rf1+ 33.Bg1 Ne2 34.h4 Rxg1+ 35.Kh2 and a clear advantage for white. However, Nikitin makes a grave mistake instead, which leads to a lost position.
22.Bb6 Nxc3! 23.Bxc7 Nxe2 24.Bb6 Rxg2
Editor’s note:
24...Nd7! led to a quick win, forestalling the idea of Bb3-a4 and intending to capture the g2 pawn in better conditions.
25.Ba4!
The threat 26.Qa8+ and 27.Qxb7+ requires black to play very energetically.
25...Rg1+! 26.Bxg1 Rxg1+ 27.Qxg1
Not 27.Rxg1 due to 27...Bxf3+ 28.Rg2 Nf4.
27...Bxf3+!
Not 27...Nxg1 because of 28.Bxc6!
28.Rxf3 Nxg1 29.Rc3+ Kd8 30.Kxg1 d5
This is the position Tal meant to reach when he made his 21st move. White manages to repel the mating threats, but he has only minimal chances of holding the endgame.
31.Rg3 Bg5 32.b4 b5 33.Bb3 f5 34.c3 Ke7 35.a4 f4 36.Rh3 Nc4 37.axb5 axb5 38.Kf2 Kd6 39.Ke2 e5 40.Bxc4 bxc4 41.Rh5 e4 42.h4 f3+ 43.Kd1 Bf4 White resigned.
This win was loudly celebrated by the excitable Georgians.
The tournament in the Georgian capital showed that Tal’s play had become more universal. The Riga grandmaster wasn’t avoiding endgames anymore; moreover, if the position demanded, he would gladly go for the ending.

8...a6 9.a4
Editor’s note:
Including the moves a7-a6 and a2-a4 allows black to avoid the checks along the a4-e8 diagonal, which are quite unpleasant, for instance, in the lines 8...h6 9.Bh4 g5 10.Bg3 Nh5 11.Bb5+! Kf8 (11...Bd7 12.Bxd7+ Qxd7 13.Ne5! and a clear advantage for white) 12.e5! (as we know, this pawn sacrifice is very good for white) or 8...Bg4 9.Qa4+! (9.Bb5+!?) 9...Bd7 (9...Nbd7? 10.e5!) 10.Qb3. Note that the line 8.Bg5 is rarely played these days.
9...h6 10.Bf4 Bg4
Editor’s note:
Since black has played h7-h6, the continuation 10...g5!? looks more logical (11.Bg3 Nh5 or 11.Be3 Nbd7).
11.Be2 0-0 12.0-0
Editor’s note:
This position (after a different move order) occurred in a number of later games, most notably Beliavsky – Kudrin, Wijk aan Zee 1985, and Mamedyarov – Bacrot, Skopje 2015. Both these games continued 12...Nh5 13.Be3 with complicated play; in the opinion of the Hungarian analyst Krisztian Szabo, white is slightly better.
12...Re8 13.Qc2
Editor’s note:
As the game’s progress showed, white achieves nothing with this move. 13.Nd2 Bxe2 14.Qxe2 (with the ideas f2-f4 and Nd2-c4) was worthy of serious consideration; this line was tested in some later games.

17...Rac8 18.a5 Nc5
Easily agreeing to swap the c-pawn for the e-pawn; after this, the game simplifies, and black gets a positional advantage.
19.Bxc4 Nfxe4 20.Nxe4 Rxe4 21.Rxe4 Nxe4 22.Qxe4 Qxc4
23.Qf3
After the queen trade, black’s advantage would have still been substantial, but with 23.Ra4!, white could still hold.
23...Qb4!
Now white can’t avoid material losses. There followed:
24.Qg3 Qxb2 25.Re1 Qb5 26.Qf3 Bf8! 27.h4 Qxa5 28.Rb1 b5 29.h5 g5 30.Qg3 Qa2 31.Rd1 Qe2 32.Rd3 Bg7 33.Qh3 Rc2 34.Bxd6 Rc1+ 35.Kh2 Qxf2 36.Rf3 Qg1+ 37.Kg3 Qe1+ 38.Kh2 Be5+ 39.Bxe5 Qxe5+ 40.Qg3 Qxd5 41.Rd3 Qc5 42.Qg4 Qe5+ White resigned.
Still, Tal couldn’t catch up with the leader. Petrosian won the tournament without a single loss. Tal shared 2nd–3rd place with Spassky.
It’s Good That You Weren’t There!
Tal traveled to the Zurich international tournament alone. After his return, we, the Riga chess players, listened to his story about the “battle in Switzerland”.
“It’s good that you weren’t there,” Tal told me. “My play in Switzerland would have perturbed you too much.”
Indeed, Tal’s play in Zurich was more than risky. However, the majority of his opponents was weaker than him, and the Riga grandmaster managed to get away with a lot of things.
Let’s look at one of Tal’s games in this tournament – it’s a great illustration of his ability to use the psychological factor in his games.
No. 52, Queen’s Gambit Declined
M. Tal – D. Keller
1959, Zurich International, round 7
1.Nf3 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 d5 4.d4 c6 5.Bg5 dxc4 6.e4 b5
So, his opponent decided to go for the complicated Botvinnik system. Trusting that Keller was well-prepared, the grandmaster made an unexpected decision.
7.a4
“This move was obviously prepared beforehand,” Tal’s opponent seemed to think. But that was not the case. We never analyzed this line at all. When Tal moved his a-pawn forward, he knew that this move didn’t give white any advantage; its only purpose was to make his opponent face an unfamiliar opening situation.
Editor’s note:
7.e5 is a much more popular move.
7...Qb6
Tal’s unusual move 7.a4 achieved its goal. Black’s first independent move is already a mistake.
Editor’s note:
Today, 7...Qb6 is not considered a mistake – it’s one of the main lines.
7...Bb4 was worth considering, after which David Bronstein recommended 8.e5 h6 9.Bd2 Nd5 10.Ne4! Be7!
Editor’s note:
Practice showed that after 7...Bb4 8.e5 h6 9.Bd2, instead of Bronstein’s move 9...Nd5, black can play 9...Bxc3 followed by 10...Nd5, with a good game. So, instead of 9.Bd2, white usually prefers 9.exf6 hxg5 10.fxg7 Rg8 11.g3 (or 11.h4).
8.Bxf6
Editor’s note:
This move has occurred the most often in practice, but grandmaster Reiner Knaak points out that 8.Be2 is more precise – after 8...Bb7 9.0-0 a6 10.d5 cxd5 (importantly, 10...Nbd7 is bad due to 11.dxe6 fxe6 12.e5 Nd5 13.Nd4 Nc5 14.Bg4) 11.Bxf6 gxf6, we get to the same position as in the actual game after move 11. Tal’s move order, however, gives a good additional resource to his opponent – see the editor’s note to move 11.
8...gxf6 9.Be2 a6
It was better to start preparing to castle with 9...Bb7.
Editor’s note:
Modern theory does not consider 9...a6 a bad move.
10.0-0 Bb7 11.d5!
Black is behind in development, so Tal hurries to open lines for an attack!
11...cxd5
Editor’s note:
Black has an interesting alternative 11...Nd7!?. Reiner Knaak thinks that black is even slightly better after this move (that’s why he recommended 8.Be2), and stats support his point of view.
12.exd5 b4
Editor’s note:
This move is a mistake, and black is now worse. The correct move was 12...Nd7 with the main line 13.axb5 axb5 14.Rxa8+ Bxa8 15.Nd4 Bc5 16.Ndxb5 Ne5. Based on the games Gorelov – Kishnev, Barnaul 1984, and Hillarp Persson – Robson, Reykjavik 2008, we can surmise that black can likely hold.
13.a5 Qc7
14.dxe6!
Only this way! White sacrifices a piece to keep the enemy king in the center. The knight retreat 14.Na4 could be met with 14...Nd7, and if 15.dxe6 fxe6 16.Nd4, then 16...0-0-0!
Editor’s note:
In Koblenz’s line, black’s last move (16...0-0-0) is a mistake, because he can’t defend after 17.Rc1. The correct reply is 16...Rg8 17.Bh5+ Ke7 18.g3 Qxa5, with unclear play.
14...bxc3 15.Nd4 Rg8 16.Qa4+ Kd8 17.g3 Bd5 18.Rfd1
Editor’s note:
Tal puts the wrong rook on d1: the correct move was 18.Rad1, with a decisive attack. The key difference is shown in the line 18...cxb2 19.exf7 Qxf7 20.Bc4!, and then, for instance, 20...Rg5 21.Bxd5 Rxd5 22.Rfe1 Nd7 23.Qc6+–.
18...Kc8
The black king finds no safe haven here.
Editor’s note:
As grandmaster Robert Huebner noted, black should have played 18...cxb2 (attacking the rook!) 19.Rab1 c3 – computer analysis shows that white had enough compensation for the sacrificed material, but little else.
19.bxc3
It was more precise to drive the black king to the b-file first with 19.Qe8+ Kb7 and only then play 20.bxc3.
Editor’s note:
Actually, white’s last move is not just an inaccuracy – it’s a serious mistake that gives his opponent a chance to save the game.
19...Bc5!
After 19...Kb7, Tal had prepared the following line: 20.Rab1+ Ka7 21.exf7 Qxf7 22.Bxc4 Bxc4 23.Qc6!!, and black can only resign.
20.e7 Nc6
The Swiss master decides to complete development. After 20...Bxe7 21.Nf5 Be6 22.Nxe7+ Qxe7 23.Bf3 Ra7 24.Rdb1, white had strong pressure along the b-file.
Editor’s note:
Analysis shows that, for instance, after 24...Rd8 (there are other good moves as well), the pressure along the b-file mentioned by Koblenz is not enough for white to even draw. So, instead of 22.Nxe7+?, white should play 22.Nd4 with enough compensation after 22...Bd7 23.Qc2 or repetition after 22...Bd5 23.Nf5.
21.Bg4+ Kb7 22.Nb5
Editor’s note:
This is a mistake that could have led to white’s defeat. Tal had several continuations that gave him adequate compensation for the piece (but not more); one of the possible lines is: 22.Nf5 Be6 (Huebner’s recommendation 22...Qe5 is met with 23.Rxd5! Qxd5 24.Rd1+–) 23.Rab1+ Ka7 24.Bf3 Bxf5 25.Qxc6 Qxc6 26.Bxc6 Bxb1 27.Rxb1 Rac8 28.Rb7+ Ka8 29.Rc7+ Kb8 30.Rxc8+ Kxc8 31.e8=Q+ Rxe8 32.Bxe8 Bd6 33.Bxf7 Be5 34.Bxc4 Kb7, with a draw.
22...Qe5 23.Re1
23...Be4
Editor’s note:
After 23...Qg5, black won, for instance: 24.Rab1 Qxg4 25.Nd6+ Kc7 26.e8=N+ Raxe8 27.Nxe8+ Rxe8 28.Rxe8 Qf3–+ (Unzicker).
24.Rab1! Rxg4
After 24...Bxb1, instead of 25.Rxe5, white would have played 25.Rxb1 with a strong attack. (
Editor’s note:
black’s position is indefensible in this case.)
25.Rxe4 Qxe4
if 25...Rxe4, then, of course, 26.Nd4+
26.Nd6+ Kc7 27.Nxe4 Rxe4 28.Qd1
28...Re5?
Black misses his opponent’s combination. After 28...Rxe7, the battle was still to come.
Editor’s note:
Instead of 28...Rxe7, black has 28...Bxe7, and after the subsequent 29.Qd5 Re5, the capture 30.Qxf7 happens (unlike in the line 28...Rxe7 29.Qd5 Re5) without a check (this was pointed out by Huebner). The computer evaluates this complicated position as equal.
I must say that Tal’s opponents would often make such mistakes.
“Tal hypnotizes his opponents,” said those who didn’t want to delve deeper into the reasons behind the “inexplicable” blunders of the grandmaster’s opponents. And Pal Benko found a “practical answer”: at the Candidates Tournament, he played his last two games against Tal wearing sunglasses...
Let’s remember that some of Emmanuel Lasker’s opponents, including Siegbert Tarrasch, also explained the ex-world champion’s wins by hypnosis.
Keller’s mistake is similar to Efim Geller’s mistake at the 25th Soviet championship or Panno’s mistake at the Portoroz Interzonal. In these cases, the Riga player’s opponents also lost drawn position “in strange ways”.
However, we shouldn’t forget that these mistakes were made after Geller and Panno had withstood a barrage of attacks from Tal. They just cracked under the pressure, and their concentration lapsed momentarily. And it’s enough to make just one mistake in chess to nullify all the previous efforts.
We should also keep in mind that Tal forces his opponents to play positions that need a great deal of time to think over, and so they often suffer from severe time trouble.
This game illustrates all those points. Up until now, Keller had bravely fought off all these problems, but just when white’s combination resources seemed to be over, he got tired and missed a simple rook sacrifice that immediately won the game.
There followed:
29.Rb7+! Kxb7 30.Qd7+ Kb8 31.e8=Q+ Rxe8 32.Qxe8+ Kb7 33.Qd7+ Kb8 34.Qxc6
and
Black resigned.
The Yugoslav Marathon
On 2nd September 1959, Tal took the plane to Yugoslavia. In August, he had played in the USSR Spartakiad, and his performance was dismal (2.5/8). Then he went to Riga for an urgent appendicitis operation, with only two weeks before the tournament! His friends were very concerned. The Candidates Tournament required great effort. Each participant of this truly marathon competition had to play 28 games!
The first-round loss to the ex-world champion Vasily Smyslov didn’t alarm Riga too much. The fans were already used to Tal’s starting losses (such as in Tbilisi and Zurich). However, when he also lost in round 3, his friends got worried.
I came somewhat late to the tournament.
I was in Belgrade during round 4 and Tal played against Fridrik Olafsson that day. After a sharp struggle, the Riga player managed to win.
The games were held in Bled and broadcast in Belgrade. Tal’s win was met with loud applause. However, Svetozar Gligoric then resigned to the 16 year-old Bobby Fischer, and the hall abruptly fell silent.
I got to Bled the next day; Tal was despondent. The loss to Paul Keres in round 3 was especially disappointing for the grandmaster. When he showed me how it happened, he said, “This game could have been my greatest win in Bled.”
No. 53
P. Keres – M. Tal
1959, Bled/Zagreb/Belgrade, Candidates Tournament, round 3
28...Nxe3! 29.Rc1
White can’t capture the knight immediately due to the threat 29...Qc6.
29...Qe7!
Editor’s note:
Black had an even stronger reply: 29...Qd7! 30.dxe3 Rxc1+ 31.Qxc1 (31.Nxc1 Qc6) 31...Qd5 32.Rb2 f5!–+.
30.dxe3 Qxh4 31.Kf1 Qh3+ 32.Ke2 Qxg4+ 33.Kd2 Rfd8+ 34.Nd4 Qg3 35.Rf4
35...Rxc1?
A serious mistake. After 35...Qg2+! 36.Be2 Qd5, black could capture the fourth pawn and maintain the attack.
Editor’s note:
The computer thinks that 35...Qh2+ is the strongest move and evaluates the position after 36.Be2 Bd5 (with the threats Bc4 and g6-g5) as won for black.
36.Qxc1 Qg2+ 37.Be2 Qd5 38.Qc7! Rd7 39.Qc4 Kg7
39...h5 was better
Editor’s note:
Actually, Tal’s move doesn’t deserve any criticism – the mistake was made later.
40.Qxd5 Bxd5 41.Bb5 Rc7 42.e4 Ba8
The game was adjourned here. The resumption started with
43.Ke3 Rc3+ 44.Bd3
44...b3
Editor’s note:
This move leads to a lost position. The correct move was 44...Bc6, and after the subsequent 45.Nb5 Bxb5 46.axb5 a4, the position is equal, for instance: 47.Kd4 Rc8 48.Rf1 b3 49.Ra1 Rd8+ 50.Kc4 b2 51.Rxa4 Rxd3 52.Rb4 Rd8 53.b6 (there’s no time to capture the b-pawn yet: after 53.Rxb2? g5 54.b6 g4 55.b7 Rb8 56.Kd4 Kg6 57.Ke3 Kg5 black manages to prevent the white king from getting to f4 and wins) 53...g5 54.b7 Rb8 55.Kd4 h5 (55...Kg6 56.Ke3!) 56.Rxb2 (now it’s possible to capture this pawn) 56...Kg6 57.Ke3 h4 (57...g4 58.Kf4=) 58.Kf3 Kh5 59.Rb1 g4+ 60.Kf4 g3 61.Rb2, with a draw. The interesting point here is that it was white who had to achieve the draw.
45.Rf1
Editor’s note:
45.Nb5! was much stronger, to first get the knight to d6, attacking the f7 pawn, and only then take care of the b-pawn. For instance: 45...Rc8 46.Nd6 Rf8 47.Rf1 h5 48.Bc4 b2 49.Rb1 Rb8 50.Bb5+–.
45...Rc5 46.Nxb3 Rxe5 47.Rc1 Rh5 48.Rc7
Editor’s note:
The correct move was 48.Kd4, immediately activating the king and not committing the rook yet. Even so, it’s unclear whether white would win.
48...Kf6
Editor’s note:
After 48...Rh3+ 49.Kd4 e5+ 50.Kc4 h5, black got strong counterplay, which, in the computer’s opinion, is enough to draw the game.
49.Nc5 Ke5 50.Nd7+ Kd6 51.Ra7 e5 52.Rxa8 Kxd7 53.Rxa5
, and
white soon won.
Tal drew with Tigran Petrosian, and then defeated Pal Benko and Bobby Fischer; with 4.5 points after the first leg, he caught up with Petrosian and Keres, who lost one game each.
The second leg started. It was no secret to Smyslov that Tal was bent on revenge. Indeed, the position was complicated from the very beginning. The foreign journalists ran to their phones to tell their editors that Tal had sacrificed a piece. Smyslov’s second, the usually calm grandmaster Igor Bondarevsky, was anxious too.
When Tal sacrificed his queen, the spectators realized that the end was near. The ex-world champion resigned on move 26.
The Riga grandmaster’s combination became a topic for a heated discussion. The Yugoslavian master Vladimir Vukovic, dubbed “the greatest skeptic of the 20th century” by his friends, would approach grandmaster Vyacheslav Ragozin, the head of our delegation, every day, trying to prove again and again that Tal’s sacrifice was unsound.
No. 54, Caro-Kann Defense
M. Tal – V. Smyslov
1959, Bled/Zagreb/Belgrade, Candidates Tournament, round 8
1.e4 c6 2.d3
We had planned to use this modest move against Botvinnik at the 2nd USSR Spartakiad, but the game didn’t take place. The purpose of this move is to avoid known theoretical lines.
2...d5 3.Nd2 e5 4.Ngf3 Nd7
Editor’s note:
The modern main line is 4...Bd6, which is most often met with 5.g3.
5.d4! dxe4 6.Nxe4 exd4 7.Qxd4 Ngf6 8.Bg5 Be7 9.0-0-0 0-0 10.Nd6 Qa5
Black could simplify the position with 10...Nb6, but Smyslov isn’t thinking about a draw.
11.Bc4
I must admit that I didn’t like this move. “What is he doing?” I fumed. “He’s helping black to organize a queenside attack.”
Smyslov quickly made his move, and I was still angry at Tal for his carelessness.
11...b5 12.Bd2!
Nobody expected this move. White is planning to transfer the bishop to c3, freeing up the g5 square for the queen. Here, I “forgave” Tal.
12...Qa6 13.Nf5! Bd8 14.Qh4!
A sudden change of “decoration”. White goes on the offensive.
14...bxc4 15.Qg5
15...Nh5
The ex-champion returns the sacrificed piece and prepares a counter-attack. After 15...g6, Tal planned to continue the attack with 16.Nh6+ Kg7 17.Bc3 Qxa2 18.Rhe1.
16.Nh6+ Kh8 17.Qxh5 Qxa2
This seemingly active move is a mistake. It was later found that the correct move was 17...Bf6. Tal saw this and planned to play 18.Bc3! Bxc3 19.Ng5! g6 20.Nhxf7+ Rxf7 21.Nxf7+ Kg7 22.Qf3 Bf6 23.Nd6 with strong threats.
Editor’s note:
Actually, 18.Bc3 is a mistake, because after 18...Bxc3 19.Ng5, instead of 19...g6?, black has 19...Bxb2+!, and after the subsequent 20.Kxb2 Qb5+ 21.Kc1 gxh6 22.Qxh6 Qf5, white’s attack is repelled, and black keeps his extra pieces (found by Kasparov). And so, instead of 18.Bc3?, white should have gone for another line shown by Tal, which led to a somewhat better endgame: 18.Nxf7+ Kg8 19.N7g5 h6 20.Ne4 Qxa2 21.Nxf6+ Nxf6 22.Qa5 Qxa5 23.Bxa5 and a slight advantage for white.
18.Bc3 Nf6
Now 18...Bf6 didn’t work due to 19.Nxf7+ Kg8
20.N3g5 Bxg5 21.Nxg5 h6 22.Qg6! (found by David Bronstein).
Editor’s note:
This line contains several mistakes: 1) Instead of 21...h6, black should play 21...Nf6! 22.Bxf6 Bf5! (Kasparov), after which it’s white who has to scramble to save the game, because black threatens 23...Qa4, and his bishop is hanging; 2) Instead of 21.Nxg5?!, the correct move is 21.Qxg5! Rxf7 22.Rhe1, and the only approach that gives black chances to survive is returning the piece and going for a clearly worse endgame after 22...h6 23.Re8+ Kh7 24.Qh5 Ne5 25.Rxe5 Qa1+ 26.Kd2 Rd7+ 27.Ke1 Qxd1+ 28.Qxd1 Rxd1+ 29.Kxd1 Rb8; 3) Instead of 20...Bxg5?, the correct move is Kasparov’s 20...Qa1+! 21.Kd2 Bxc3+ 22.bxc3 Nf6! with better chances for black; 4) Instead of 20.N3g5?, white should play 20.N7g5, for instance, 20...Qa1+ 21.Kd2 Bxc3+ 22.bxc3 Nf6 (Kasparov) 23.Qf7+!? Rxf7 24.Rxa1, with a drawn endgame.
19.Qxf7!
This queen sacrifice wins.
19....Qa1+ 20.Kd2 Rxf7 21.Nxf7+ Kg8 22.Rxa1 Kxf7 23.Ne5+ Ke6 24.Nxc6 Ne4+ 25.Ke3 Bb6+ 26.Bd4 Black resigned.
The game was awarded a special prize.
Both I and Tal’s official second, Yuri Averbakh, were quite satisfied with his play in Bled. Tal was just half a point behind the leader, grandmaster Paul Keres. We were glad to see that living in Bled, which is located in a beautiful mountain region, was beneficial to Tal – he looked noticeably healthier and fresher.
The next leg was played in the capital of Croatia, Zagreb. The results of the first half of the tournament were evaluated differently by the players.
Fischer was disappointed because of his many losses and the organizers’ “tactlessness”: he received children’s soap in pretty wrapping as a gift.
Benko was sad to part with the fun casino and dancing. The grandmaster complained that he was unable to find a better coach. His second, Yugoslav master Maric, said, “Like player, like coach.”
Olafsson and his three coaches were especially unhappy. The Icelandic grandmaster sadly contemplated his return to the homeland, which had organized a special fundraiser to help him travel to the tournament.
Tal was secretly mad at me: I had asked the table tennis lovers not to play him because of his recent operation. However, film footage showed Tal waving the little bat anyway...
The cinema people were rather happy. They managed to film Petrosian as a gondolier during a boat ride on the lake with his second, grandmaster Isaak Boleslavsky. The cameras caught Olafsson and Gligoric in the swimming pool, and Keres out fishing.
And then, we boarded the bus heading to Zagreb. Fischer seemed to have left his worries behind. In answer to Tal’s question about whether he’d ever been to an opera, the American sang the smugglers’ march from
Carmen
in a soprano.
“Tell me, Bobby,” Tal continued his interrogation, “how do you like Volpert’s game style?”
Fischer thought for a bit, then answered very seriously, “She’s too cautious. But you have another woman player, Dmitrieva, I like her games!”
When the grandmasters disembarked at the fashionable Zagreb hotel Esplanada, they were immediately surrounded by a crowd of chess fans.
The first round in the Croatian capital yielded some unexpected results. Keres blundered in an equal position against Fischer and had to resign. Petrosian lost to Olafsson.
The influx of spectators was so huge that the organizers had to place a demonstration board on the balcony of the playing hall. Thousands of people watched the battle between the candidates, and one of the streets in the center was closed off for a few hours.
The game between Tal and Smyslov attracted the most interest.
It was broadcast in Riga by phone. At first, the people were happy, but then, when the middlegame started, they began to ask anxious questions:
“How do you evaluate Tal’s position? Will he be able to survive?”
I couldn’t say anything good. Tal’s loss seemed inevitable. However, he was still putting up fierce resistance in severe time trouble. Each of Smyslov’s moves saw an immediate, lightning-fast reply. And then, the ex-world champion, who usually keeps his cool even in the most difficult conditions, suddenly lost concentration. He got into time trouble as well, missed a simple tactical threat, and Tal saved the game with perpetual check.
Here’s how the finale of this dramatic game played out.
No. 55
V. Smyslov – M. Tal
1959, Bled/Zagreb/Belgrade, Candidates Tournament, round 15
At this point, Tal considered his position quite tenable, but just several moves later, he started to think a lot. As the subsequent play showed, he had every reason for that.
15.exd5 cxd5 16.b4 Nd7 17.Nb3! e5
Black’s active operations in the center don’t reach their intended goal. With several precise moves, Smyslov manages to attain a decisive advantage.
18.Bf5 e4 19.Rec1!
A typical “Smyslov” move – simple and yet very strong. The threat 20.Rxc8 and 21.Bxd7 doesn’t leave much choice for black.
19...Qd6 20.Nd4
After this move, Tal thought for 40 minutes. The threats 21.Rc6 and 21.Bxh7+ with the subsequent 22.Nf5 are very unpleasant.
20...Bf6 21.Rc6 Qe7 22.Rac1 h6
22...Be5 didn’t work due to 23.Bxh7+ Kxh7 24.Qh5+ Kg8 25.Nf5, and if 25...Qd8, then 26.Rxc8!. (
Editor’s note:
Instead of 26.Rxc8, white could win much more rapidly: 26.Rh6! gxh6 27.Nxh6+ Kg7 28.Nf5+ with a quick mate.)
23.Rc7!
Now black can’t avoid material losses.
23...Be5 24.Nc6 Qg5 25.h4
It seems that nothing can save black from a loss. Among other things, he had just two minutes left to make fifteen moves.
25...Qxh4 26.Nxe5 Nxe5 27.Rxc8
Of course, the simplest move was 27.Bxc8, and after 27...Nd3 – 28.Bb7. After the game move, black has some chances to continue the struggle...
27...Nf3+ 28.gxf3 Qg5+ 29.Kf1 Qxf5 30.Rxf8+ Rxf8 31.fxe4 dxe4
After getting an extra piece, Smyslov started playing without confidence.
32.Qe3 Rd8 33.Qg3 g5 34.Rc5
34.Qc3 f6 35.Qb3+ with the subsequent 36.Rc6 won immediately.
34...Rd1+ 35.Kg2 Qe6 36.b5 Kh7
37.Rc6
Editor’s note:
White’s last move is a mistake (the correct reply was 37.Rc3, controlling the third rank), which Tal could have exploited with 37...Qf5! (instead of 37...Qd5?), not just with the ideas 38...Qxb5 and 38...Rd3, but also forcing the opponent’s queen to guard the f3 square (38.Qh2?? Qf3#). After the subsequent 38.Rc1 Rd3 39.Qe5 Qg4+ 40.Kf1 Qh3+ or 38.Rc3 Qxb5 39.Qh3 Qf1+ 40.Kg3 Qb5 41.Kg2 (41.Bc1? e3! 42.Bxe3 Qe5+, winning) 41...Qf1+ (41...Qxb2?? 42.Rc6+–) 42.Kg3 Qb5, the game ends with a threefold repetition.
37...Qd5
38.Qe5?
Smyslov, who was in time trouble too at this point, misses a simple tactic. After 38.Qe3 Rd3 39.Qb6! e3+ 40.Kh2, black had to resign.
Editor’s note:
Actually, 38.Qe3 is no good either: it is met with 38...Qf5! (threatening 39...Qg4+ 40.Qg3 Qe2–+), and white has no way to win: 39.Rf6 Qg4+ 40.Qg3 Qh5 41.Qh2 Qg4+, 39.Qe2 Rd2! 40.Qxd2 Qf3+, or 39.Rc1 Rd3 40.Qe2 Rd2! 41.Qxd2 Qf3+, with a draw in all lines.
There was a good move 38.Rc1! – after the subsequent 38...Rxc1 (38...e3+ 39.Qf3+–) 39.Bxc1 Qxb5 40.Qd6 white should win after overcoming some technical difficulties. However, the strongest continuation was 38.Qh2!! (threatening to take on h6) 38...e3+ 39.Kg3, and black is defenseless.
38...Rg1+ 39.Kh2 Rh1+ 40.Kg2 Rg1+
Taking the rook results in perpetual check, and so the opponents agreed to a
draw
.
In round 16, Tal defeated Gligoric, and Keres drew with Smyslov. Thus, Tal overtook the Estonian grandmaster by half a point. It seemed that the Riga player, who had black against Keres in round 17, could just settle for a draw. But Tal declined the peace offer made by his opponent on the 18th move. This was a critical decision. The position was incredibly sharp, but Tal was going exactly for that. If he won, he could increase his lead further.
No. 56
P. Keres – M. Tal
1959, Bled/Zagreb/Belgrade, Candidates Tournament, round 17
19...Qd4!?
Of course, 19...Be7 was more solid.
19...Qd4!? 20.h4 Qxb2 21.Rd1 Bd4 22.Rd3 Qxc2 23.Rxd4! exd4 24.e5 Kf8! 25.exf6
Without a doubt, Keres saw that he could force a draw with 25.Bxf6 Qc1+ 26.Kh2 Qxh6 27.Bg5 Qg7 28.Bf6 Qh6 29.Bg5, but he preferred to play for a win.
Editor’s note:
Keres’ move is a mistake that leads to a lost position for white.
25...Qc3! 26.Qg4 Qe1+ 27.Kh2 Qxf2 28.Qh3 Qe1 29.Qb3 b5 30.axb5 cxb5 31.Qa3+ b4 32.Qb3 Qe5+ 33.Kh1 Qe1+ 34.Kh2 Qe5+
Both opponents were in time trouble at that point.
35.Kh1 Qd6 36.Kg1 d3
36...Qc5 was more cautious, and if 37.Bd2, then 37...a5.
37.Qd1
Many commentators pointed out that white had the move 37.Qc4 available. Then 37...d2 is bad due to 38.Bxd2!, and black can’t play 38...Qxd2 due to 39.Qc8+ Re8 40.Qc5+, mating. Further, after 37...b3 38.Qc8+ Re8 39.Qc4 Re6 40.Qc8+, white forces a draw. (
Editor’s note:
After 39.Qc4, black doesn’t have to play 39...Re6; instead, he can play 39...Re1+ 40.Kf2 Re2+ 41.Kf1 Qe6 42.Qb4+ Ke8 43.Qb8+ Kd7 44.Qb7+ Kd6 45.Qb6+ Kd5 46.Qxb3+ Kd4 47.Qb4+ Qc4 48.Qxc4+ Kxc4 49.Nxf7 Re6 50.Nd8 d2 51.Bxd2 Rxf6+ 52.Ke2 Kb5, maintaining winning chances, even though white probably should hold. However, instead of 39.Qc4?!, white has a much better move: 39.Qb7, forcing black to give perpetual check with 39...Qd4+ 40.Kh2 Qe5+ etc.) However, Tal’s intended 37...Qb6+ 38.Kh2 Qb5! 39.Qc8+ Re8 still won.
37...Qc5+ 38.Kh1 Qc2 39.Qf3 d2 40.Bxd2 Qxd2 White resigned.
In round 20, Tal won his third game against the U.S. champion.
No. 57
M. Tal – B. Fischer
1959, Bled/Zagreb/Belgrade, Candidates Tournament, round 20
Black played
20...dxc5
without much thought. The seconds of foreign grandmasters exchanged knowing smiles. They, like Fischer, thought that Tal had just lost a pawn. However, just a few moves later, it turned out that Fischer had lost a lot more...
21.Bd3! cxb4 22.Rae1 Qf6
22...Qd6 was better.
23.Re6
Editor’s note:
23.Na4 was a stronger move with the threats 24.Bxf5+ and 24.Qxc7 and a big advantage. Had Fischer now continued correctly, it would have turned out that the white rook’s position on e6 was not ideal: if the knight leaves d7, it falls under attack.
23...Qxc3
Editor’s note:
The only correct move was 23...Qg7, still protecting the h-pawn with the queen. It’s also important to note that the queen would have covered the f8 rook and attacked the c3 knight, and the c7 pawn was also protected after the knight left d7. There could follow: a) 24.Bxf5+ Kh8 25.Qxb4 a5! 26.Qd4 (26.Nxa5? Nc5!) 26...Qxd4+ 27.Nxd4 Nc5; b) 24.Qxb4 a5! 25.Nxa5 Nc5 26.Re3 (26.Qxc5? Bxe6 27.dxe6 b6 with a clear advantage for black) 26...Nxd3 27.Rxd3 Ra6; or c) 24.Rf3 Ndf6 25.Rg3 Qf7 26.Bxf5+ Kh8 – black should probably hold in all cases.
24.Bxf5+ Rxf5 25.Qxf5+ Kh8 26.Rf3!
Now black is defenseless. After
26...Qb2 27.Re8 Ndf6 28.Qxf6+ Qxf6 29.Rxf6 Kg7 30.Rff8 Ne7 31.Na5! h5 32.h4 Rb8 33.Nc4 b5 34.Ne5
, the
American grandmaster resigned.
Tal bolstered his tournament standing with wins against Benko and Olafsson. After round 21, he had scored 15.5 points, Keres had 14, and Smyslov and Petrosian were on 11.5 each.
On 15th October, the last, decisive leg of the tournament started in Belgrade. There was an eye-catching headline in the evening newspaper that reported on the tournament: “Seven grandmasters approaching Belgrade, Tal approaching Botvinnik!”
The interest in the Candidates Tournament in Belgrade was huge. The tournament hall couldn’t accommodate everyone. The games were demonstrated on the streets.
It was rather hard for Tal. Each evening, the grandmasters were surrounded by hundreds of chess enthusiasts at the exit. The supporters walked with Tal to the hotel, and the grandmaster had to answer questions and give autographs all the way.
Tal had every chance to gain first place, but the battle hadn’t yet ended. The games of the Zagreb leg drained much of his strength, and now, at the finishing line, Tal was noticeably tired.
In the game against Smyslov – the first round of the last leg – he played too riskily and lost a knight. Only Smyslov’s weak play in time trouble saved the leader from defeat.
Before the game with Keres, Tal resolutely declined advice to calmly play for a draw against the Estonian grandmaster.
“Keres has two and a half fewer points, and I have no moral right to avoid a fight.”
These weren’t just words. Even though Tal couldn’t play at his full strength because of his tiredness, he didn’t avoid complications. Keres exploited his opponent’s opening mistake and won convincingly.
Tal drew his next two games, against Petrosian and Olafsson, and then won his fourth game with Fischer out of four. We should point out that Tal barely avoided big trouble in this game: his risky opening play allowed Fischer to create a strong attack.
Before the last round, Tal had one point more than Keres. His opponent was Benko. As I said earlier, Benko came to the game against the leader wearing sunglasses – he had found his remedy against hypnosis!
Tal’s countermeasure caused a merry stir in the hall. He greeted his opponent, sat down and, before making a move, also put sunglasses on.
When Tal offered Benko a draw in a better position, the latter pretended not to hear his opponent. However, peace was agreed after some time. In a winning position, Tal forced a perpetual check. He had won the Candidates Tournament!
At the press conference, Tal said, “I have dreamed of playing at least one game against the world champion for quite a while, and I’m happy that I will get to play a whole match against him!”
Reactions after the Candidates Tournament
The results of the Candidates Tournament and Tal’s victory were discussed by chess players throughout the world. Despite the young grandmaster’s brilliant successes in recent years – two Soviet championship wins and first place at the Portoroz and Zurich tournaments – many chess fans were still surprised when the 23 year-old Riga player triumphed at the Candidates.
Tal’s ascent to the very top was truly rapid. In just nine years, the young player had progressed from first-category player to world championship candidate!
In his article “Modern Chess”, the ex-world champion Max Euwe wrote, “We cannot talk about modern chess without mentioning Tal’s name. The incredible combinations that arise in his games as though summoned by a magic wand are something more than just brilliant fireworks. This is a manifestation of the new style. With his efforts, Tal, despite his youth, has taken an important part in building the strong edifice of chess art, the foundation of which was laid more than a hundred years ago.”
In the article “M. Tal’s Victory”, published in
Shakhmaty v SSSR
, grandmaster Alexander Kotov highlighted that “...Tal’s example will help our chess youth to understand the beauty of chess, to understand how they should play.”
“What’s most characteristic of Tal’s playing style? The desire to create unclear, double-edged positions and seize the initiative at any cost, without regard to sacrifices,” said grandmaster Vyacheslav Ragozin, FIDE Vice-President, at the Candidates Tournament closing ceremony.
Here are some examples that illustrate these features of Tal’s creative style.
No. 58
M. Tal – S. Gligoric
1959, Bled/Zagreb/Belgrade, Candidates Tournament, round 16
It looks like both sides are going to castle and then begin long positional maneuvering. However, Tal’s next move changes the situation drastically.
16.d5!
Editor’s note:
This move could have led to a very unpleasant position for white.
16...Qe7
Gligoric refuses to accept the pawn sacrifice, because after 16...exd5 17.cxd5 Bxd5 (if 17...Nxd5, then 18.Be4!) 18.c4 Bc6 19.Nf5, white has a threatening initiative.
17.0-0 Nd7
Editor’s note:
After 17...0-0-0! black seizes the initiative. The point is, after 18.dxe6? (white wins an exchange this way, but the opponent’s bishop becomes rather dangerous) 18...fxe6 19.Ng6 Qg7 20.Nxh8 Rxh8, black pushes the h-pawn forward, creating a very dangerous (and probably decisive) attack. Instead of 18.dxe6, white has a stronger move 18.e4, but after 18...Nd7 with the subsequent Nc5 black is in the driver’s seat: the a4 and c4 pawns are weak, the idea f7-f5 is in the air, and white has no way to create any activity.
18.dxe6 Qxe6 19.Bf5! Qxc4
Editor’s note:
As it soon transpires, the queen is positioned badly here. The right move was 19...Qe5, with unclear play.
20.Rfd1 Nf6 21.Rd4 Qc6
It seems that the first wave of the attack is over – it’s unclear how white can increase the pressure. However, Tal finds an elegant combination maneuver, and black’s position soon becomes very difficult.
22.Be6!
Editor’s note:
Actually, this move allows black to consolidate, whereas after 22.Bd3! (not just threatening 23.Bb5, but with a lot of other ideas as well, such as, Rf4, Rc4 and Nf5), white has an overwhelming position.
22...Rg8 23.Bc4! Kf8
Editor’s note:
Analysis shows that after 23...0-0-0!, the position was dynamically equal. One example line: 24.Qf5+ Nd7 25.Qxf7 Rgf8 26.Qe6 h5 27.Bb5 Qxc3 28.Bxd7+ Rxd7 29.Ng6 Rxf2! 30.Qe8+ Rd8 31.Ne7+ Kb8 32.Qxd8+ Ka7 33.Kxf2+ Qc2+ 34.Ke1 Qxb1+ 35.Rd1 Qb4+ 36.Rd2 Qc3! 37.Nf5 Qc1+ 38.Rd1 Qc3+ with perpetual check.
24.Bb5 Qc5 25.Rc4 Qe5 26.Rxc7 Be4 27.Bd3 d5 28.Rc6 Rb8 29.c4
, and, gaining a great positional advantage,
white won
on move 64.
After Tal took the lead, he could have afforded to play quietly, but, even in the last rounds, he still preferred to take risks.
In another game against Gligoric, in the fourth leg, Tal chose a double-edged line in the King’s Indian. After 18 moves, the following position occurred on the board:
No. 59
S. Gligoric – M. Tal
1959, Bled/Zagreb/Belgrade, Candidates Tournament, round 23
18...Nxd5
Black doesn’t get enough material compensation for the sacrificed knight, but pressure along the e-file helps him maintain a long-term initiative. White faced many difficulties while neutralizing this pressure, and he ultimately cracked.
19.exd5 Bf5 20.Qc3 Bg7 21.Qc1 Bxb1 22.Bxg7 Kxg7 23.Qxb1 Nf4 24.Nde3 Qe5
Gligoric makes the right decision: he returns the piece to get some freedom in maneuvering.
25.Bxb5 Rxb5 26.Nf5+
Editor’s note:
The correct move was 26.g3 with a roughly equal position after 26...Kf8 (the king evades a possible Nf5+) 27.gxf4 Qxf4.
26...gxf5!
Editor’s note:
Objectively speaking, Tal’s move is questionable. 26...Qxf5 27.Qxf5 gxf5 28.Rxe8 Nxd5 was stronger, getting an endgame with a tiny material advantage. On the other hand, even though only black would have chances of winning, they were actually quite marginal because of his compromised pawn structure. Tal’s move leads to an equal but complicated position that suits his style much better.
27.Rxe5 Rxe5
Black gets enough compensation for the queen.
28.g3 Ne2+ 29.Kf2 Kg8?
The first consequence of time trouble. Black should have played 29...Nd4.
30.Ne3?
White, affected by the pressure, makes a mistake too. After 30.f4! Re8 (if 30...Re4, then 31.Nd2) 31.Qxf5, he got a material advantage.
30...Nd4 31.f4 Re4 32.g4??
Suicide! The necessary move was 32.Nxf5!, with equal chances.
32...Rxf4+ 33.Kg2 fxg4 34.Nc4 Nf3 35.Qc1 Rf6 36.Qe3 Kf8 37.Qe4 Rb8 38.Qxh7 Re8 39.Qh8+ Ke7 40.Qg7 Nh4+ 41.Kg1
Time trouble has ended, but white can’t do anything – his position is hopeless.
41...Nf3+ 42.Kg2 Rg6 43.Qc3 Nd4 44.b4 Kf8 45.Ne3 g3! 46.h3 Rf6 White resigned.
In addition to his attacking skills, Tal showed his great defensive technique at the Candidates Tournament.
No. 60
F. Olafsson – M. Tal
1959, Bled/Zagreb/Belgrade, Candidates Tournament, round 11
21...g6 22.Bxg6 Qe7!
Black sees through his opponent’s smart plan. After 22...hxg6 23.Qxg6+ Kh8 white doesn’t settle for perpetual check: with 24.Nf5!! Bxb2 25.Rf3!, he checkmates his opponent.
23.Bxf6 Nxf6 24.Qf3 Rb8 25.Bd3 Bb7 26.Qe2
White’s attack is repelled, but he still maintains a positional advantage. Tal slowly outplays the Icelandic grandmaster and goes on the counter-attack.
26...Kh8 27.Rce1 Rbe8 28.Nf5 Qb4 29.Qb2 Rc8 30.Ng3
White has wasted precious time on knight moves, and his opponent has managed to seize the c-file.
30...Qc3 31.Qe2 Rg8 32.Ne4 Qd4 33.Ng5 Rg7 34.Qe3 Qxe3 35.Rxe3 Rc3 36.Rh3 b4 37.Kg1
37...e5!
The signal for a counter-attack!
38.Rg3
Editor’s note:
Olafsson’s last move is a blunder. The correct reply was 38.Rh6, and after the subsequent 38...Ng4 39.Rxh7+ Rxh7 40.Bxh7 Ne3 41.Re1 exf4 42.g3 fxg3 43.hxg3, white should draw easily.
38...e4 39.Bc4 d5 40.Be2 d4 41.Bc4 e3 42.Rd1 Bd5! 43.Bf1 Re7 44.Be2 d3 45.Bxd3 Rxd3 46.Rxd3 e2 47.Rge3 e1=Q+
, and
black won.
The Candidates Tournament win didn’t go to Tal’s head. The laudatory articles that now and again appeared in the press didn’t impress him much. Tal remained the same as he always was. He understood the necessity of hard work and further self-improvement.
He realized clearly that his play was not free of serious drawbacks. It was obvious that in games against Soviet players Tal wasn’t always on top of his situation. Didn’t his three losses to Keres attest to that? In one of those games, he got carried away and sacrificed two pieces without good reason, the other was won by the Estonian grandmaster in a complicated, maneuvering struggle. The game against Smyslov in round 22 could also have ended badly for Tal, who disregarded the objective requirements of the position. And didn’t the games against Fischer (round 27) and Olafsson (round 11) show how much excessive danger Tal voluntarily went for?
Only Fourth Place...
After a short rest, we started preparing for the match against Botvinnik: we read the latest Soviet and foreign chess magazines and opening monographs and, of course, studied the world champion’s games.
Tal was very glad to hear the news that an international tournament would be held in Riga. The grandmaster preferred this way of training above anything else.
The tournament didn’t bring Tal any laurels. He finished only fourth, behind Spassky, Mikenas and Tolush. Nevertheless, the pre-match competition was beneficial: it was good practice, showing on what we needed to work.
Tal’s result in the Riga tournament was predetermined after losing to his main competitor, Boris Spassky. The distance was short, and it soon became clear that Tal wouldn’t be able to catch up with the Leningrad grandmaster.
No. 61, Ruy Lopez
B. Spassky – M. Tal
1959, Riga International, round 3
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 0-0 8.c3 d6 9.h3 Na5 10.Bc2 c5 11.d4 Qc7 12.Nbd2 Bd7 13.Nf1 Rfe8 14.d5 c4 15.g4
Editor’s note:
This move never found any adherents among strong players. For instance, in the games Landa — P. Nikolic, Germany BL 2004, and Azarov — V. Kovalev, Minsk 2010, white preferred 15.Ng3 and then executed the plan Nh2 and f2-f4.
15...h5
This aggressive move is a strategic error. The correct reply was 15...g6.
16.gxh5 Bxh3 17.N3h2 Nh7
Editor’s note:
It was better to play 17...Nb7, intending Nc5 at the earliest opportunity. In the actual game, this knight didn’t properly enter the battle at all.
18.Ne3 Bg5 19.Kh1 Bf4 20.Rg1 Qd8 21.Qf3
Threatening to start an attack with 22.Nf5.
21...Qh4
Another “active” move. In actuality, black’s position is already critical.
22.Ng2 Bxg2+ 23.Qxg2 Qxh2+
A forced trade, because after 23...Qf6, white gets a strong attack with 24.Be3 and the subsequent 25.Qh3 and Ng4. (
Editor’s note:
Instead of 24.Be3, white had an even stronger move 24.Bxf4! exf4 25.Qh3 with various ideas, for instance, Ng4, Nf3, e4-e5, Rg1-g4 and Ra1-g1 etc. – analysis shows that in this line white has a decisive advantage.)
24.Qxh2 Bxh2 25.Kxh2
Spassky has got a noticeable advantage with simple means. The defense is going to be difficult for black.
25...Nf6 26.Rg5 Nh7 27.Rf5 g6 28.Rf3 Kg7 29.hxg6 fxg6 30.b4! cxb3 31.axb3 Nb7 32.b4
Fixing the backward pawn a6 in place and taking away the important c5 square from the knight.
32...Rec8 33.Bd2 Nf6 34.Bd3 Rh8+ 35.Kg2 Ng4 36.Kg3 Nf6 37.Kg2 Ng4 38.Rh1 Rxh1 39.Kxh1
39...a5?
Passive defense does not sit well with Tal, and he tries to activate his queenside pieces. However, the b-pawn is now severely weakened. It was better to transfer the knight from g4 to c7 first.
40.Kg2 a4 41.Rh3 Nf6 42.Bh6+ Kf7 43.Rf3 a3 44.Bb1 a2 45.Bxa2 Rxa2 46.Bg5 Rc2 47.Rxf6+ Ke8 48.Rxg6 Kd7 49.Rg7+ Kc8 50.Be3 Rxc3 51.Bb6! Rc4 52.Rg8+ Kd7 53.Rb8 Nc5 54.bxc5 dxc5
, and, without waiting for his opponent’s reply,
Tal resigned.
Vladas Mikenas defeated Tal as well.
Tal’s desire to go for complications no matter the cost brought him success in the next game.
No. 62, Modern Benoni
I. Niemela – M. Tal
1959, Riga International, round 7
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6 4.Nc3 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 6.e4 g6 7.f4 Bg7 8.Nf3 0-0 9.Be2 Re8 10.e5 dxe5 11.fxe5 Ng4
12.e6
A little explored double-edged move, involving a pawn sacrifice. Alekhine recommended 12.0-0 in this position. By parting with the e5 pawn, white retains good attacking chances.
12...fxe6 13.0-0
Editor’s note:
A bad move. There are two much stronger replies: 13.d6 (the most frequent move) and 13.Bg5 – according to modern theory, chances are roughly equal in both cases (white has fair compensation for the pawn, but no more).
13...exd5 14.Nxd5 Be6 15.Bc4 Ne5
Black provokes his opponent to sacrifice a piece. After 16.Nxe5 Bxe5, white has no compensation for the pawn.
16.Bg5! Nxf3+ 17.Qxf3 Qxg5 18.Rae1 Rf8!
Tal placed all his hopes in this move.
19.Rxe6?
Paul Keres wrote this about the move in the tournament bulletin: “It’s hard to master this complicated position even in home analysis. However, one thing is clear: the game move leads to a quick defeat. Perhaps there were two better move for white: firstly, 19.Qxf8+ Bxf8 20.Rxe6 Nc6 21.Nc7, and black has to give up another rook; secondly, just play 19.Qe4, and there’s no good move to defend the e6 bishop.”
Editor’s note:
Keres’ first line doesn’t help white: after 19.Qxf8+ Bxf8 20.Rxe6 Nc6 21.Nc7, there follows 21...Kg7 22.Nxa8 Qd8 (threatening 23...Qd4+/23...Qxa8), and black wins (Sassen – Mooij, corr 1974). However, 19.Qe4 is indeed a good move and the only possibility to continue the struggle, even though after the subsequent 19...Nc6 20.Qxe6+ Kh8 white has no compensation for the pawn.
19...Bd4+!
White missed this Zwischenschach. He expected 19...Rxf3, with a decisive attack after 20.Re8+. Now the black king can escape to g7.
20.Kh1 Rxf3 21.Re8+ Kg7 22.Rxf3 Qc1+ 23.Bf1 Nc6!
Launching a winning counter-attack.
24.Rxa8 Ne5 25.Rff8 Ng4 26.Rf3 Nf2+ 27.Kg1 Ne4+ White resigned:
after 28.Kh1, black has the elegant 28...Ng3+! (29.hxg3 Qh6#).
Tal made a fascinating intuitive sacrifice of two minor pieces for a rook and pawn in a game against a Norwegian master.
No. 63
M. Tal – S. Johannessen
1959, Riga International, round 6
12.Bxf7+!
Like 12...Nxe4 in the game against Averbakh at the 25th Soviet championship, this double-edged move caused much discussion.
“I think that such sacrifices actually don’t need any concrete calculations: it’s enough to look at the position to see that this sacrifice should be correct” – that’s what Tal himself said about the move.
Editor’s note:
From Koblenz’s subsequent notes, it’s clear that he wasn’t sure that Tal’s operation was correct from the analytical point of view (see his note to black’s 15th move), so the exclamation mark awarded by him for this move obviously describes only its practical strength. Computer analysis shows that white’s move was dubious.
12...Rxf7 13.Nxf7 Kxf7 14.Qb3+ Kf8 15.Rac1
The white pieces have assumed ideal positions, whereas it’s hard for black to complete his queenside development.
15...a6?
Preventing the move 16.Nb5. Now, however, black has no time to develop his queenside. Keres recommended 15...Qb6 16.Nb5 Ne8 here, which Tal intended to meet with 17.Qc4. In this case, it’s hard to determine whether white has enough positional compensation for the lacking material. One thing is clear: black would have still faced difficult problems. (
Editor’s note:
After the subsequent 17...Ne5 18.Qe2 Bg4 19.f3 Be6 20.b3 Rd8, black completes his development and gets an advantage: two pieces for a rook and pawn and the bishop pair. As for the game move, it’s certainly not good, but awarding a question mark to it was probably too harsh.)
16.Rfd1 Qa5
Editor’s note:
This is an error. The correct move was 16...Qb6 — for instance, 17.Qc4 Qxb2 18.Nd5 Nxd5 19.Qxd5 Qb5 20.Qe6 Qf5 21.Qc4 Qb5, with threefold repetition.
17.Qc4!
(preventing 17...b5)
Editor’s note:
White had a much stronger reply 17.Nd5! (threatening 18.Nc7/18.Nxe7), and black’s position becomes very difficult, for instance, 17...Nxd5 (after 17...b5?, the simplest is 18.Nc7 Ra7 19.Ne6+) 18.Rxd5 Qd8 19.Rd2 Qe8 20.Qd1 Bf6 21.e4 (threatening 22.e5) 21...Kg7 22.Rc7 Qf7 23.Rdc2+–.
17...Qf5
Editor’s note:
Black could resist better with 17...Qc5 18.Qe2 (neither 18.Qe6 Qb6 nor 18.Qb3 Qb6 leads to any progress) 18...Qf5 (or 18...Qh5) — the white queen is much less active on e2.
18.h3! Ne8! 19.Nd5 Qe6 20.Qb4 b5
Even after 20...Be5, recommended by Keres in the tournament bulletin, white still maintained a significant advantage with 21.Rc4. (
Editor’s note:
Instead of 21.Rc4?!, white has a much stronger reply: 21.Bxe5 Qxe5 22.f4 Qe6 23.e4 with an overwhelming position. However, black could have prolonged the resistance with 20...a5! 21.Qb5 b6, not fearing 22.Rc6? due to 22...Ba6!.)
21.Rc6!
Gaining a decisive tempo. Interestingly, white’s winning combination follows at the very moment when the Norwegian master seemed to have overcome his troubles.
21...Qf7 22.Nc7 Nxc7 23.Rxc7 Qe6 24.Rdc1!
The threat 25.Rxc8+ is unstoppable. After 24...Ne5, there’s 25.Qe4, winning.
24...Nb6 25.Rxe7! Nd5 26.Rxe6+ Nxb4 27.Bd6+ Black resigned.
The Draw is Made!
We’re in Moscow, in Max Euwe’s room in the National Hotel; the ex-world champion arrived from Netherlands a few hours ago for the opening ceremony of the Botvinnik-Tal match. The official part is scheduled for the next day, while this evening the draw is made to determine who’s going to make the first move in the match.
There’s a small crowd around the little round table: world champion Mikhail Botvinnik with his second Grigory Goldberg, Max Euwe, Harry Golombek (the Englishman is one of the arbiters), Lev Abramov (the USSR Chess Federation executive secretary), Mikhail Tal and yours truly – his second.
We’re waiting for the match chief arbiter – Swedish grandmaster Gideon Stahlberg, who got delayed somewhere between Stockholm and Moscow. To make the best use of the time, we discuss the match regulations. One of the clauses states: if the tournament hall becomes too noisy, the arbiters are obliged to move the game to another room if one of the players’ seconds requests it.
“Do you have any objections?” Botvinnik asked Tal.
“No, why should I?”
The other points are agreed upon just as quickly. Abramov looks at his watch. Stahlberg still hadn’t arrived.
Goldberg, who’s sitting beside me, tells some story. I’m trying to listen attentively, but understand nothing. In my mind’s eye, I involuntarily see episodes of days long past...
May 1935... I’m sitting in a London cafe with Emanuel Lasker, the man who defeated the first world champion, legendary Wilhelm Steinitz, in 1894. I’m talking to the man who deservedly bore the world champion’s crown for 27 years and, despite his age of 67, finished third at the Second Moscow International tournament without losing a single game!
The “iron” Lasker is polite and gentle in real life. Before expressing his thoughts, he looks somewhere far away, still holding a cigar in his mouth.
“Many wondered why I forfeited the match against Capablanca after just 14 games,” Lasker says. “The official version was that I was defeated by the tropical climate of Havana. But this is not the only reason. I didn’t want to die in poverty, like Steinitz, so I demanded appearance fees to play in tournaments, which angered the rich sponsors who organized the tournaments. I was constantly hounded by the press, which was in their pocket.”
Lasker fell silent and, exhaling another cloud of smoke, continued:
“With each day, I felt more and more isolated and lonely. I was so fed up that I decided to demonstratively relinquish the world champion’s title.
When thousands of spectators flocked to the spacious halls of the Moscow International tournament, my heart was full of joy. I didn’t doubt that the talented and hard-working Mikhail Botvinnik would move mountains – it just couldn’t be any different!”
...Hastings, an English resort town, January 1935. The traditional Christmas tournament had just finished. Late in the evening, a group of chess players surrounded a short young man in the lobby of a hotel. This is grandmaster Salo Flohr. He’s enthusiastically talking about chess life in the USSR, saying that chess has become a part of people’s culture, it’s played in factories and schools.
When Flohr said that he saw slogans such as “Overtake the capitalist countries on the chess front!” in clubs, his listeners exchanged looks. Many of them smiled ironically. This is a utopia! The West has great players such as Capablanca, Lasker, Euwe, Reshevsky, Fine! And what do they have? They only have Mikhail Botvinnik – a quiet, reserved young man who couldn’t show anything remarkable here in Hastings, only sharing 5th–6th place. An argument immediately started, and Flohr exclaimed in exasperation: “Botvinnik will show you all, you’ll see!”
The skeptics didn’t have to wait for long. Just a few months later, the Soviet grandmaster stunned the entire world by sharing first place with Flohr at the Second Moscow International tournament, ahead of the leading Western grandmasters, including Lasker and Capablanca.
...Moscow, 1948. The Pillar Hall of the House of the Unions, lit by crystal chandeliers. The spectators applaud Mikhail Botvinnik. Far away, on the stage, grandmaster Milan Vidmar, the chief arbiter of the World Championship match tournament, pulls the new world champion into a tight embrace.
As I remember all that, I sense the historical importance of this evening even more sharply. Knowing that tomorrow Misha Tal, a boy from Riga, is going to challenge the renowned leader of the Soviet chess school for the world championship title, makes my heart beat even faster.
And then, the tired, breathless Swedish grandmaster finally arrives. We can proceed with the draw.
The next day, at 4:55 p.m., the arbiters, players and their seconds arrive on stage at the Pushkin Theater, greeted by loud applause. Numerous photographers, both Soviet and foreign, click their camera shutters.
5 p.m. Stahlberg asks the photographers to leave the stage and starts white’s clock. The match begins.
No. 64, French Defense
M. Tal – M. Botvinnik
1960, Moscow, World Championship Match, game 1
After thinking for a minute, Tal moves his king’s pawn:
1.e4
Botvinnik, also after a minute’s thought, moves his king’s pawn as well, but only one square forward:
1...e6
Studying Botvinnik’s opening repertoire, we of course paid most attention to his signature opening – the French Defense – which he played very successfully with black. We considered the possibility that the world champion would play the first game in a sharp style, to prove to his aggressive opponent that his hopes for success in a combination battle were futile. Eschewing quiet continuations, we concentrated our attention on the line that occurred in the game Gligoric – Petrosian at the Candidates Tournament.
This was precisely the line that occurred in the first game:
2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Qc7 7.Qg4
7...f5
Editor’s note:
The move 7...f6 is now more popular at grandmaster level.
8.Qg3 Ne7
Editor’s note:
Modern strong players prefer 8...cxd4 or 8...Nc6 here, while the game move is considered dubious.
9.Qxg7 Rg8 10.Qxh7 cxd4 11.Kd1
Editor’s note:
Both actual games and analysis show that 11.Ne2! is more dangerous.
11...Bd7
The world champion uncorks a novelty in the very first game! Petrosian played a much weaker move 11...Nbc6, and after 12.Nf3 Nxe5 13.Bg5! got a difficult position. The purpose of 11...Bd7 is not just to complete development, but also, if possible, to launch a counter-attack with Ba4, threatening d4-d3.
12.Qh5+ Ng6+
Editor’s note:
A better move here is 12...Kd8!, as black usually played in subsequent games.
13.Ne2 d3 14.cxd3 Ba4+
It was better to play 14...Nc6 and then castle long.
Editor’s note:
1) From the analytical point of view, after 14...Nc6 15.d4 0-0-0 16.Qf3, white’s two extra pawns are more valuable than his opponent’s activity. Still, black definitely retains some practical chances. 2) The computer doesn’t consider the game move a mistake: it thinks that Koblenz’s recommendation 14...Nc6 and Botvinnik’s actual move are more or less equally good (but only if after 14...Ba4+, black plays 15...Nc6, which didn’t happen in the game).
15.Ke1 Qxe5
Editor’s note:
15...Nc6 with subsequent long castling gave black far better practical chances; instead of regaining one of two lost pawns, black should have placed his hopes on activity.
16.Bg5! Nc6 17.d4 Qc7
18.h4!
The pawn isn’t going to be promoted in the near future. The main purpose of this move is getting the h1 rook into play as soon as possible.
18...e5
Practically the best move.
19.Rh3! Qf7 20.dxe5 Ncxe5 21.Re3 Kd7 22.Rb1 b6
22...Bc6 was more resilient.
23.Nf4 Rae8 24.Rb4 Bc6
25.Qd1!
Now white’s attack cannot be stopped.
25...Nxf4 26.Rxf4 Ng6 27.Rd4 Rxe3+ 28.fxe3 Kc7 29.c4! dxc4 30.Bxc4 Qg7 31.Bxg8 Qxg8 32.h5 Black resigned.
Before game 6, Tal asked me, “For how long will I be kept in the stalls?”
This comparison was very apt for the second, fourth and fifth games. All these games were played in a quiet, positional style, and the Riga player had a hard time holding off the attacks of his formidable opponent.
In these games, Tal, as usual, strove for tactical complications, but Botvinnik decided, completely correctly, that trying to compete in line calculations with the young grandmaster, or, to put it simply, playing as his opponent wanted, was not exactly in his interests.
Botvinnik was 25 years older than his opponent. With age, chess “reflexes”, especially in positions rife with tactical opportunities, undoubtedly slow down. We also have to consider that the world champion had rarely competed in big tournaments in recent years. The lack of practice also showed most clearly in sharp positions.
This was convincingly proven in the third game, when after
1.e4 c6 2.Nc3 d5 3.Nf3 Bg4 4.h3 Bxf3
, Tal made a paradoxical move
5.gxf3!?
.
“You shouldn’t play chess like that,” Tigran Petrosian said the next day.
The commentators unanimously criticized the move as well.
But should we really have to prove that if a grandmaster plays such a move, it’s not because he “doesn’t know what’s he doing”? He knows the general positional considerations – any first-category player would decide against 5.gxf3 because of them. However, the move 5.gxf3 does have a purely positional foundation: it bolsters white’s center and opens the g-file to put pressure along it.
We prepared 5.gxf3 chiefly out of psychological considerations. The resulting position was hard to anticipate beforehand. Tal’s calculations paid off: the world champion spent 40 minutes on his first eight moves. In the ensuing battle, Tal needlessly decided not to execute his initial plan, got into a difficult position and had to give up a pawn. Still, Botvinnik ended up in time trouble – precisely at the time when there were great complications on the board. In the end, he had to struggle for a draw.
It became clear to us that, after this game, Botvinnik would avoid lines that led to unclear positions rich with mutual tactical chances.
Only in game 6 did the challenger finally manage to create a double-edged position with great complications on the board.
No. 65
M. Botvinnik – M. Tal
1960, Moscow, World Championship Match, game 6
14...Rfc8
Tal wrote about this move: “Black (partly out of psychological considerations) has decided to concentrate his efforts on the queenside and then, when his opponent lets his guard down, play f7-f5. I must admit that I already had the idea of sacrificing a knight on f4, but it was hazy at the time. Black put his king’s rook on c8 for two reasons: to keep the a7 pawn protected and to convince white that he wasn’t even thinking about the kingside.”
15.Rb1 Nh5 16.Be3 Qb4 17.Qe2 Rc4
Editor’s note:
From Tal’s comment above, it’s clear that the psychological aspect played an important role in his plan – as we shall see, black’s last move, which is aimed at a very complicated struggle, paid off completely from this point of view. On the other hand, had white found the best (but completely counter-intuitive!) reply a few moves later (see the editor’s note after his 19th move), he could have gotten a big advantage precisely because of the black rook’s position on c4. Objectively speaking, 17...a6 was stronger (to protect the pawn from possible future attacks), but then, after 18.Rfc1, white would have some space advantage on the queenside and just get a slightly better, quiet position. While had black played 17...f5?!, then, after 18.exf5 Bxf5 19.Rbc1 Nf6 20.Nb5, white would clearly have the initiative.
18.Rfc1 Rac8
Editor’s note:
According to the computer, the strongest move here is to return the rook to its previous position, 18...Rcc8, which Tal probably never even considered. On the other hand, the prophylactic 18...a6 (getting the pawn away from the attack) is bad due to 19.a3! Qb3 20.Bf3, threatening both to capture on h5 or play 21.Qd2, intending to trap the queen with 22.Bd1.
19.Kh2
White’s strategic plan is not hard to understand: he’s intending to trade queens with 20.a3 Qb3 21.Qd1! and transition into a better endgame.
Editor’s note:
Botvinnik likely made his last move to be able to play Bg2-f3 without worrying about the h3 pawn.
19.Bxa7 would have been met with 19...f5 with good compensation; in many lines, the resource Qb4-a5 is important, for instance: 20.Bf1 (with the idea 21.Qd2) 20...Qa5 21.Be3 (after 21.Qe3 Rb4, the white bishop on a7 is in big trouble) 21...f4 22.gxf4 exf4 23.Bd2 Qd8 with dangerous activity for the pawn.
However, the computer first forces black to commit to a queen move with 19.a3!, after which black’s position is difficult. After 19...Qb3, it’s now good to play 20.Bxa7 (much better than 20.Qd1? Qxd1+ 21.Rxd1 b5 22.Bxa7 b4 23.axb4 Rxb4 24.Be3 f5 with good compensation), getting a healthy extra pawn (20...b6 is not now a threat due to the simple 21.Qc2, while 20...f5 can be met with 21.Qd1 and a clear advantage or, even better, 21.Bf1 with the threat 22.Qd1). However, 19...Qa5 is even worse for black due to 20.Bf1! with a very strong threat 20...-- 21.Qe1 R4c7 22.Ra1!! and 23.b4, with no good defense in sight.
After Tal’s reply
19...f5!
, the hall buzzed like a beehive.
20.exf5 Bxf5 21.Ra1 Nf4!?
Editor’s note:
21...Nf6 is objectively stronger, but with the subsequent 22.g4 Bd7 23.a3 Qa5 (after 23...Qb3, the queen has no good squares and poses no threat) 24.Qd2 (intending Bg2-f1), white thwarts his opponent’s activity and remains slightly better because of his queenside space advantage.
Applause filled the hall.
Botvinnik’s second asked the arbiter to move the game to an isolated room.
Stahlberg was trying to quiet the public, while Golombek repeatedly pushed the button that lighted the electric sign “Quiet, please!”
Meanwhile, dramatic events unfolded on the board.
22.gxf4 exf4 23.Bd2
Editor’s note:
Black’s idea was refuted with 23.a3! (but, of course, not 23.Bxa7? Qa5) 23.a3! Qb3 (23...Qa5 24.Bd2+–) 24.Bxa7. Kasparov discovered that after the subsequent 24...Be5 25.f3! b6 (up until this point it was Tal’s analysis), white won with 26.a4!! with the ideas 27.a4-a5 and 27.Ra3 Qb4 28.Na2.
23...Qxb2
23...Be5 was stronger, but Tal decided against it because of the line 24.f3 Qxb2 25.Nd1! Qd4 26.Rxc4 Rxc4 27.Rc1 Rxc1 28.Bxc1 Qxd5 29.Bf1, thinking that the position was equal.
24.Rab1 f3 25.Rxb2
Botvinnik decided to trade queens while being a piece up, but probably missed Tal’s 26th move.
Grandmaster Salomon Flohr showed the following beautiful line several days later: 25.Bxf3! Bxb1 26.Rxb1 Qc2 27.Be4!! Rxe4
28.Nxe4!!
Now, after both 28...Qxb1 29.Nxd6 Rf8 30.Qe6+ Kh8 31.Nf7+ Rxf7 32.Qxf7 Qf5 33.Qxf5 gxf5 34.Kg3 Be5+ 35.Bf4 and 28...Be5+ 29.Kg2 Qxb1 30.Nxd6! Bxd6 31.Qe6+ Kg7 32.Qd7+!, white is better in the endgame.
25...fxe2 26.Rb3 Rd4! 27.Be1 Be5+ 28.Kg1
Here, Goldberg categorically demanded to move the game to another room.
The excitement in the hall had already subsided, so I thought that such a radical measure was not necessary. But the arbiter had already made a decision, and only demonstration boards remained on the stage.
28...Bf4
Here, probably as a result of this sudden change of environment, Tal missed a pretty combination: 28...Rxc3! 29.Rbxc3 Rd1 30.Rc4 Bb2, and black wins. However, after this move, white still can’t save the game.
29.Nxe2 Rxc1 30.Nxd4 Rxe1+ 31.Bf1 Be4
With active bishops and an extra pawn,
black won
easily.
This loss affected Botvinnik’s play in the next game. The world champion made a mistake in a good position, and the score was 5-2.
Now, having a three-point lead, Tal should have played more quietly, giving Botvinnik the opportunity to sharpen the position himself. However, Tal rejected such considerations right from the outset.
In game 8, Botvinnik gained a substantial advantage, but again got into time trouble and couldn’t find the right move.
No. 66
M. Botvinnik – M. Tal
1960, Moscow, World Championship Match, game 8
Botvinnik had three minutes left on his clock, while Tal had thirteen. White to move.
34.Rc1
A blunder. After 34.Rd4, white kept his advantage.
34.Rc1 Rbc8?
That night, during our analysis, we saw that black could have won with 34...Rec8. Tal had rejected it at the board out of general considerations – the rook could be useful to put pressure on the e-file.
Had Tal won, the score would have become 6-2, and the match would have been essentially over. This thought plagued us for the entire night. The well-known truth – a chess player should embrace his failures – wasn’t much consolation in this case.
But let’s come back to the game. Events unfolded quickly.
35.Na5 Bxe2 36.Rxe2 Nxc3 37.Rxc3! Rxc3 38.Nxb7
Here, Tal realized that the position had changed drastically, and I should say that he got confused. He automatically made a bad move, and suffered quickly from the consequences.
38...Rexe3
Black should have played 38...Rb8 39.Nxd6 Rd3 40.Nxf5 Rxd5 41.e4 Rxf5 42.exf5 Rxb6, and the game would have ended in a draw. (
Editor’s note:
Actually, after the subsequent 43.Kf2 Rb3 44.Re3, black loses. But instead of 41...Rxf5, black had 41...Rb5, after which it’s white who has to scramble for a draw. So, instead of capturing on f5 on the previous move, white should play 40.Rc2!, and after 40...Rxb6 41.Nxf5 Rxd5 42.Rc8+ Kh7 43.Rc7+, the game ends in perpetual check.)
39.Rxe3 Rxe3 40.Nxd6 Rd3 41.Nf7+!
Botvinnik’s sealed move. As soon as it was played on the board at the resumption,
black resigned
.
In game 9, Tal, after
1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5 5.Ng3 Bg6 6.N1e2 Nf6 7.h4 h6 8.Nf4 Bh7 9.Bc4 e6 10.0-0 Bd6
, sacrificed a piece –
11.Nxe6!?
Tal’s own opinion about this sacrifice is quite interesting.
“I can’t agree with the numerous experts who criticized my opening choice, in particular, the knight sacrifice on e6. Tellingly, the majority of them don’t think that the knight sacrifice was absolutely incorrect. Most commentators agree that this sacrifice creates major difficulties for black. Concerning the psychological side, I think that if a chess player is convinced that his move is correct, he should have no ‘buts’ and no excuses if he deviates from his initial plan. Before game 9, we did overestimate the knight sacrifice a bit, thinking that black had to go for a difficult defense after the correct continuation, which is not that easy to find. We made a psychological mistake there. The point is not that the player who has a two-point lead (after just one-third of the match played) shouldn’t go for sharp lines. This is completely acceptable. Our mistake was underestimating Mikhail Botvinnik’s phenomenal analytical power, thinking that he wouldn’t expect the sacrifice. But the first moves after the sacrifice, and especially the fact that Botvinnik played rather rapidly, convinced me that my opponent had thoroughly analyzed the position that occurs after the sacrifice.”
When, after
11...fxe6 12.Bxe6 Qc7 13.Re1
Editor’s note:
An important alternative is 13.Nh5!?, which occurred, for instance, in the game Tal – Vukic, Bugojno 1978
13...Nbd7 14.Bg8+ Kf8! 15.Bxh7 Rxh7 16.Nf5
Botvinnik sacrificed a third pawn with
16...g6!
, it was clear to everyone that the world champion’s defensive maneuver was prepared beforehand.
White had enough compensation for the piece, but the Riga player failed to convert his chances, and
Botvinnik won
his second game in a row with precise play.
Tal’s mood after game 9 was aptly described by the man himself:
“Up until game 8, it was psychologically very hard to play: on the one hand, I had a subconscious feeling that the match was already almost over, but on the other hand, I realized that I still had a long and hard struggle ahead of me against such an unyielding player as Mikhail Botvinnik.
Now, after the match, I think that my losses in games 8 and 9 helped me to get out of that psychological dead end in the best possible way. After the score reached 5-4, the moment of weakness was overcome, and an equal struggle ensued; I believed in myself much more at the moment.”
Indeed, Tal played more quietly and confidently in the tenth game, and Botvinnik barely managed to draw.
In game 11, Tal defeated his opponent with his own weapon: giving the world champion no counterchances, he executed an attack in good positional style.
This defeat meant much more for Botvinnik than the simple loss of a point. The world champion had to admit that his opponent was able to outplay him strategically as well!
No. 67, Grunfeld Defense
M. Tal – M. Botvinnik
1960, Moscow, World Championship Match, game 11
1.Nf3 Nf6 2.g3 g6 3.Bg2 Bg7 4.0-0 0-0 5.c4 c6 6.b3 Ne4 7.d4 d5 8.Bb2 Be6
8...a5 was stronger. (
Editor’s note:
The strongest players of our time play 8...Bf5 most often.) After the game move, white gets a positional advantage.
9.Nbd2 Nxd2
Editor’s note:
Black could have gained more chances for counterplay with 9...f5!?, transposing into a line of the Dutch Defense. Another interesting move is 9...Qa5!?, which occurred in Sasikiran – Melkumyan, Bastia 2011.
10.Qxd2!
After 10.Nxd2, black had a strong reply 10...c5! After the game move, it’s not beneficial for black to win the pawn with 10...dxc4 due to 11.Ng5 cxb3 12.Nxe6 fxe6 13.axb3, and white has enough compensation for the pawn – pressure on both the queenside and the kingside. (
Editor’s note:
In the elite grandmaster game Vachier-Lagrave – Aronian, Saint Louis 2014, white, instead of Koblenz’s 13.axb3, played a novelty 13.Qe3!?, and after 13...bxa2 14.Qxe6+ Kh8 15.Qxa2, his compensation was more than enough.)
10...Na6
(
Editor’s note:
According to the MegaDatabase, this move was played only once, in this game)
11.Rac1 Qd6 12.Ne5 Rfd8 13.Rfd1 Rac8 14.Qa5
The queen on this square constrains black’s forces. He can’t offer a queen trade with 14...Qb4 or 14...Qc7 due to 15.Nxc6!. (
Editor’s note:
Actually, both these lines are OK for black: both after 14...Qb4 15.Nxc6 bxc6 16.Qxa6 dxc4 17.Ba3 Qb6 18.Qxb6 axb6 19.bxc4 Bxd4 20.Bxe7 Rd7 and 14...Qc7 15.Nxc6 bxc6 16.Qxa6 dxc4 17.bxc4 c5 18.e3 cxd4 19.Bxd4 Bxc4 20.Qa4 e5 21.Bf1 exd4 22.Rxc4 Qb8 23.exd4 Rxc4 24.Qxc4 Qd6 25.d5 Bf8 he has good drawing chances, despite being a pawn down.)
14...dxc4
Editor’s note:
The best move was probably 14...Bxe5!?, recommended by Tal and favored by the computer – black keeps his center stable, exchanges an important knight and intends to trade the queen as well. Kasparov came to the conclusion that after 15.dxe5 Qb4 16.Bc3 (up to this point – analysis by Tal) 16...Qxa5 17.Bxa5 b6 18.cxd5 Bxd5 19.Bh3 Ra8 20.Bd2, white has only a marginal advantage. Also, in this line, black can play 15...Qc7!? (instead of 15...Qb4). After the game move, black is also only slightly worse, but it’s harder to defend in a cramped position when there are still a lot of pieces on the board; in addition, white’s pawn center now becomes more dynamic. We should also note that there are some improvements for both sides in the next few moves.
15.Nxc4 Qc7
Botvinnik attempts to simplify the position with trades.
16.Qe1! Qb8 17.e4 Bxc4! 18.Rxc4 Nc7 19.Bh3 e6 20.Bc1 Qa8!
(
Editor’s note:
By defending the c6 pawn, black creates the threat 21...b5)
21.Bg5 Re8 22.Qd2 f5! 23.Bh6
Editor’s note:
This bishop exchange is not good, because now black manages to successfully regroup his major pieces and equalize. Instead of Tal’s move, the computer recommends the following plan: deprive black of the resource Nb5 with 23.a4, then play Re1, put the bishops on f4 and g2 and go for d4-d5 or h2-h4-h5.
23...Bxh6 24.Qxh6 Re7 25.Re1 Rf8 26.Rc5 Qd8 27.Re5
27...Ref7!
Grabbing the pawn (27...Qxd4) was no good: after 28.exf5 gxf5 29.Bxf5, white retained a minimal advantage. (
Editor’s note:
Kasparov showed that in Koblenz’s line, black has no difficulties at all: 29...Ref7 30.R5e4 Qf6 31.Qxf6 Rxf6 32.Bxe6+ Nxe6 33.Rxe6 Rxf2 34.Re7 – Tal erroneously thought that white was still slightly better here – 34...Rxa2 35.Rxb7 Rd8, with an obvious draw. Also, Kasparov pointed out 30...Qc5!?, after which black is all right as well.) Now white has to think about defending the d4 pawn.
The world champion managed to coolly defend and parry all the threats; however, to fully equalize, he still needs to make some precise moves.
28.Qd2 Qd6 29.Bf1! Rd7 30.exf5 Rxf5 31.R5e4 Rf6?
With 31...Rd5!, black could have forced a draw: 32.Bc4 Rxd4 33.Rxd4 Qxd4 34.Qxd4 Rxd4 35.Bxe6+. In the ensuing time trouble, Botvinnik was noticeably nervous.
32.h4! Kg7 33.h5 gxh5 34.Rh4 Kg8 35.Bd3 Rg7
Editor’s note:
After this move, black is in big trouble. One of the better continuations was 35...Kf8, getting the king to safety. If white plays 36.Re5, like in the game, then, after 36...Rdf7, he has nothing better than 37.Re2, which, of course, doesn’t sit well with his attacking plans.
36.Re5! Rff7
Editor’s note:
And now, it’s too late to double rooks: 36...Rgf7 37.Rexh5 Rxf2 38.Qg5+ Kf8 39.Rxh7+–.
37.Qh6
Editor’s note:
The queen will have to return after a couple of moves. The immediate 37.Rexh5 was stronger.
37...Qe7 38.Rexh5 Nd5! 39.Qd2! Nf6 40.Rh6 Qd6 41.Rf4
It was time to adjourn the game. After a 40-minute think, Botvinnik sealed the move
41...Qf8
.
Analysis showed that black’s position was very difficult. The queen move was the least expected for us. The main continuations we analyzed were 41...Ng4, 41...e5, and 41...Nd7.
After 41...Ng4, there was a strong reply 42.Bxh7+ Kf8 43.Rxf7+ Rxf7 44.Rg6 Rxf2 45.Rg8+ Kf7 46.Qd3, and black loses one of his pieces.
After 41...e5, we first looked at 42.Rf5. However, we decided against it because of 42...Qxd4, threatening 43...Rxg3+. So we quickly agreed on 42.dxe5 Qxe5 43.Rf5! Qa1+ 44.Kg2, and white wins quickly. 41...Nd7 couldn’t save black either due to 42.Rxf7 Kxf7 43.Bxh7 c5 44.Qe2!, and white’s attack is unstoppable.
42.Qe3 Nd5 43.Rxf7 Qxf7 44.Qe5!
With 44.Qxe6, white could win a pawn; however, after 44...Qxe6 45.Rxe6 Rg4 46.Bc4 Kf7, the position was easier for black to defend.
44...Nc7 45.Qc5! Qf3
A small trade combination follows.
46.Bxh7+! Rxh7 47.Qg5+ Kh8 48.Qd8+ Kg7 49.Rxh7+ Kxh7 50.Qxc7+ Kg6 51.Qxb7 Qe4 52.Qa6!
White is two pawn ups, but to convert his advantage he needs considerable technique. For instance, if white takes the third pawn with 52.Qxa7, black gets a strong passed pawn in the center after 52...Qe1+ 53.Kg2 Qe4+ 54.Kh2 Qf3 55.d5. (
Editor’s note:
Koblenz means that black will take on d5 with one of his pawns.)
52...Qe1+ 53.Kg2 Qe4+ 54.Kf1 Qb1+ 55.Ke2 Qc2+ 56.Kf3 Qf5+
If 56...Qc3+ or 56...Qd1+, then 57.Kg2, and white wins an important tempo.
57.Ke3 Qg5+ 58.Ke2 Qh5+ 59.Kd2 Kf6 60.Qxc6 Qa5+ 61.Qc3 Qxa2+ 62.Ke3 Kf7 63.d5! exd5 64.Qc7+ Kf6 65.Qc6+ Ke7 66.Qxd5
, and
black resigned
several moves later.
This tenacious battle lasted for seven and a half hours.
In game 12, Tal had the initiative as well. However, both players were quite tired and didn’t play too precisely. The game ended in a draw on move 72.
Quick bloodless draws upset the spectators, who expect exciting fights in every game. You can understand the spectators, but you should understand the players as well – the match is exhausting and requires total concentration. That’s why Tal wanted to make peace quickly in the thirteenth game, even though he played black. He needed to consolidate his success. In addition, the Riga grandmaster felt very tired.
After 50 minutes of play, Tal achieved a draw, but this game upset him a great deal.
Tellingly, Tal left the Pushkin Theater through the back entrance after the game – he didn’t want to face the fans...
A month of tenacious struggle, endless analysis of adjourned games that often lasted the whole night – all that was exhausting for both players.
The knowledge that a legion of chess fans is watching the match helped to overcome tiredness. Letters from the whole country flowed in every day. The young grandmaster was greeted by people he knew and people he didn’t, but everyone wished him victory. They gave advice, even offered their “proven” opening lines that “guaranteed” success.
“Keep going, Misha, we believe in you!” people of various ages and walks of life wrote.
Mikhail Fetisov, a Don Cossack, sent a touching, encouraging telegram:
“Mikhail, you will win, you have to win! The sons should be stronger than the fathers. If this wasn’t so, the world wouldn’t make progress!”
The next three games were also drawn, but those weren’t “grandmaster draws”. Peace was agreed only after all possibilities to fight for a win were exhausted.
Tal turned reserved and reticent. I realized that there was no sense in advising him to “play coolly” and “stabilize the position”.
During lunch before game 17, we didn’t say a word to each other.
“This time,” I thought, “there would be no draw...”
At first, the game was peaceful, and it was hard to predict that it would end so dramatically. When the following position occurred on the board, I was in the press center.
No. 68
M. Tal – M. Botvinnik
1960, Moscow, World Championship Match, game 17
The grandmasters and masters, filling the room as usual, expected 12.Qd2 here and thought that the game would end in a quick draw.
But the clock was ticking, and Tal was still thinking. Finally, he played
12.f4
.
“This looks like suicide!” the oldest Soviet grandmaster, Grigory Levenfish, exclaimed.
“Now it’s clear that Tal will lose this game,” said someone at the other end of the room.
I quickly came on stage to evaluate the position independently of others’ opinions.
If Tal loses, everything starts anew... Yes, white did seriously weaken the center with his last move. Nevertheless, Tal’s plan was clear: avoid the queen trade at all costs and increase the pressure.
I often saw Tal go all-out and succeed, but in this game his position was growing increasingly worse. With simple, logical moves, the world champion was improving his position. And Tal tried to sharpen the game at any cost, regardless of material losses.
The battle reached its culmination. Both players were in time trouble. The first to lose his cool was... Botvinnik’s second, Grigory Goldberg. He closed his pocket chess set, stood up quickly and left the stage. Sometimes imminent victory makes you even more anxious than impending defeat...
Of course, I was anxious too. Will Tal still keep his fighting spirit, I thought, if the score turns 9-8?
The fate of the game was decided literally in the last seconds. Botvinnik missed a tactical blow – a rook sacrifice. While spectators, seconds and arbiters considered whether the sacrifice was correct, time trouble ended. The match arbiter gave Botvinnik an envelope, so that the world champion would seal his move. But he never sealed a move. Ten minutes later, after Botvinnik convinced himself that his position was hopeless, he resigned. This game decided the fate of the whole match.
There were many discussions about Tal’s “strange” twelfth move. In his book about the Botvinnik match, Tal shared his thoughts.
“The unfamiliar quiet match strategy turned out to be more difficult for me than I had imagined. And it suffered a total fiasco in game 17.
It’s hard to make yourself play every game with the same desire to win, but it’s even harder to move towards the goal with tiny steps. The goal of making seven draws in the remaining eight games seemed incredibly hard for me.
Before the game and during the opening, I was totally sure that I would follow the advice of my experienced coach, the advice that had helped me to keep the pleasant two-point gap. But at a certain time (I think this feeling is familiar to every chess player), I just couldn’t help but do what was forbidden. Very, probably excessively risky play completely unexpectedly brought me an important point. I realized that the quiet, waiting strategy wouldn’t work for me in the remaining games – I just couldn’t keep my nerves in check. I made my moves automatically – sometimes good, sometimes not so good, but playing according to the match score just wasn’t working... Such a foolish strategy almost led to a disaster in the next, 18th game. Only Botvinnik’s uncertainty in time trouble prevented him from punishing me.”
And now, let’s look at Tal’s concrete considerations for moving the f-pawn.
“Finally, my wandering gaze settled on the move 12.f4. At first, I felt somewhat uncomfortable, because the flaws of this move are quite obvious, but in such a position there are no moves without flaws. The merits of this move are less obvious, but they do exist, even if, if I may say, not strictly in the chess dimension. First of all, this move requires refutation, and this refutation involves a double-edged tactical battle, which, considering M. Botvinnik’s playing style in this match, was not desirable for him. Secondly, the weakness of white’s position could only be exposed with a break in the center, and after c6-c5 and e6-e5, the white bishops become significantly stronger. And, finally, black would be able to attack the kingside only after castling long, but this would allow white’s queenside pawn mass to move forward too. Perhaps black just had to play 12...0-0, but this is not a refutation of 12.f4.”
These explanations help to understand Tal’s unique creative methods. Objectively, 12.f4 may be a bad move, but against that specific opponent in that specific situation, it provided real chances.
After game 19, where Tal scored his sixth win in a strictly positional style, the world champion’s second said, “So, we’ll meet in the return match.”
To become world champion, Tal needed to score just one point in the last five games. Game 20 was drawn, and Botvinnik came to the 21st game without his customary bottle of vitamin drink – the fate of the match had been already decided. The world champion offered a draw himself on move 17.
The score turned 12.5-8.5. The match was over.
The very next day after winning the title, Tal came to realize that the burden of glory was indeed very heavy. His hotel room was literally “occupied” by his friends and journalists. Even the Riga newsreel film crew were there, with all their bulky equipment.
The closing ceremony and the crowning of the world champion took place on 10th May.
...Mikhail Tal, the Komsomol member and Riga City councilor, takes the stage. FIDE Vice-President Marcel Berman places a gold medal on his chest and crowns him with a laurel wreath.
“On behalf of the International Chess Federation,” Marcel Berman says, “I declare Mikhail Tal the world chess champion.”
The Soviet anthem plays triumphantly...
Gens Una Sumus
“We are one family”. These words from the ancient language of Latin comprise the motto of the International Chess Federation. We’re at the 14th Chess Olympiad in Leipzig. People are talking in different languages – German, Russian, English, French, Spanish, Mongolian, many others – but chess players need no translators: the universal language of chess can be understood by everyone.
At the reception organized by the East German government in honor of the chess players, Paul Keres spoke on behalf of the Olympians:
“Despite our opposing interests, there’s cordial friendship at the tournament of nations. I think that many should learn how to maintain the spirit of international solidarity here!”
The last words are drowned in applause. The American chess players approach the Soviet team’s table and raise their glasses in friendship – friendship between the chess players of all countries, friendship between all nations.
Bobby Fischer offers to tell Tal’s future.
“OK. Tell me, Bobby, how will the return match against Botvinnik end?” Tal asks.
Fischer looks intently at the world champion’s palm and says, “You don’t like to lose!”
“Who does?”
The loud laughter stopped Fischer’s palmistry session.
We made a lot of new friends in Leipzig. Chess people from many countries asked the Soviet players for advice, and shared their joys and sorrows with them.
We learned that free Cuba had revived the glorious chess traditions of Capablanca, that chess was becoming widely popular among the people.
“We are proud that our country gave chess to humanity,” said the Indian journalist Chandragupta Agrawal in a short interview. “After winning independence, our team is taking part in the team world championship. We are obviously weaker than players from many other countries, but we’ll do everything in our power to catch up.”
Bombay student Manuel Aaron proved that these weren’t empty words. In the match against the Netherlands, he defeated the ex-world champion Max Euwe, while in the Argentina match, he drew with grandmaster Miguel Najdorf.
The English and French chess players had a hard time believing that the Mongolian government had assigned a comfortable three-story building to a chess club.
Concurrently with the Olympiad, Leipzig organized an exhibition entitled “Chess Through the Ages”.
It was quite a challenge to view all the exhibits sent by 150 museums and many private collectors from all over the world over such a short period of time.
The Soviet exhibition opened with a stand “Lenin and chess”. In the section “Chess is the people’s game”, foreign chess players could find the answer as to why new chess talents keep coming up every year in the land of socialism. The showcase of Soviet chess literature stunned the foreigners with huge print numbers: 30,000, 50,000, 100,000 copies...
In the same showcase, I saw our
Sahs
magazine, both in Russian and Latvian, as well as books published by the Latvian State Publishing House.
Everyone marveled at the chess pieces made by Russian artisan Shushkanov and inspired by the story of Sadko. These fairytale pieces were earlier awarded a Great Gold medal at the Brussels World Fair. The Central Art Workers’ House poster for the David Oistrakh versus Sergei Prokofiev chess match attracted much attention as well.
The average attendance of each round in Leipzig was around 5,000 – it’s a record for chess competitions.
The last round couldn’t change much in the tournament table. The Soviet team had already won, the US team had finished second, and Yugoslavia had taken third place.
We are accustomed to the success of the USSR national chess team, which always wins gold at the Olympiads. When the event is already won, the days of difficult battles get slowly forgotten. Those who follow the competition only in newspapers may think that the victory of our chess players, who are stronger on average than the foreign masters and grandmasters, was easy, almost a foregone conclusion. But those who witnessed the Olympiad in person know how difficult the decisive games truly were. The results were only settled literally in the last minutes...
The Soviet grandmasters were happy to write a new page in the history book of Soviet sports victories with their Leipzig win.
Mikhail Tal was, without a doubt, the most popular player at the Olympiad (world champions are always the center of attention). In the last round, Tal made sure that there was a sensation – he lost to the English player Johnathan Penrose.
“Now I have enough work for a year,” Penrose said after the game with a smile. “I’ll be going from town to town and showing my game against the world champion!”
Tal’s game against the Hungarian grandmaster Laszlo Szabo was rather interesting.
Szabo, an aggressive, attacking player, got a position to his taste. It seemed that Tal wouldn’t be able to withstand the onslaught of the black pieces. But in the close-quarter street fight, Tal suddenly launched a counter-attack and crushed black’s position.
No. 69
M. Tal – L. Szabo
1960, Leipzig, 14th Olympiad Final, round 4
Szabo gets rid of his double pawns and seizes the initiative.
22...b5 23.Bc5 b4 24.Na4 Rxe4 25.Bxd6 cxd6 26.Rxd6 Qe7
(planning to bolster the attack with a pawn sacrifice)
27.Rd2! Nh5
Editor’s note:
27...Re8 posed more problems for his opponent, activating the rook and retaining various options for the knight.
28.g3 Bh3 29.Ng2 Re8 30.Nc5
Tal thought for long on each move, while Szabo played quickly and assuredly: he thought that black’s attack would suggest itself. The next move was made by the Hungarian grandmaster without much thought either.
30...Re2
A mistake. The correct move was 30...Bxg2+ 31.Kxg2 Re3, with an equal position.
Editor’s note:
Actually, after the game move the position is equal as well.
31.Rxe2 Qxe2 32.Kg1 Bxg2
(white threatened 33.
R
e1)
33.Kxg2 Qg4
Editor’s note:
33...Qb5! was a much stronger move (on this square, the queen protects both the a6 and c6 pawns and completely nullifies the idea Qd4-c4+) 34.Qd4 Ng7=.
34.Qd4!
White goes on the counter-attack. Now it was Szabo’s turn to think for a while.
Editor’s note:
34.Qf3 was probably stronger – on the one hand, white is targeting c6, while on the other hand, he offers to transition to an endgame which will be better for him – black’s a- and c-pawns are too weak.
34...a5 35.Rf2 Kf7
Editor’s note:
This move is a mistake, and black’s position is now very hard. He should have preferred 35...Qf5, improving the queen’s position.
36.Ne4 Kg7
Editor’s note:
36...Re7 still gave black some chances to save the game.
37.Qa7+ Kg8 38.Nd6 Rf8 39.Qxa5 Qe6 40.Qxb4 Qd5+
(a “death-bed” check!)
41.Kg1
Szabo sealed his 41st move, but then resigned without resuming the game.
We were sitting in the Astoria hotel restaurant, eating our lunch. Several hours remained until the USSR – Argentina match. Suddenly, the opposing team’s leader, Miguel Najdorf, appeared before our table, holding a napkin.
“I’ll accept all your sacrifices,” he jokingly assured Tal. “You see, I’ve successfully competed with world champions Capablanca and Alekhine!”
“I’ll make a sacrifice for sure. I hope you’ll keep your promise,” the world champion answered.
In the following game, you shall see if they kept their promises.
No. 70, Sicilian Defense
M. Tal – M. Najdorf
1960, Leipzig, 14th Olympiad Final, round 4
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e6 6.Be3 a6 7.f4
Editor’s note:
This move is not popular in modern times. The main line is 7.f3, protecting the e4 pawn and intending Qd2 and g2-g4.
7....b5 8.Qf3 Bb7 9.Bd3 Nbd7 10.0-0
Editor’s note:
10.g4 is usually played in this position.
10...Be7 11.a3 0-0
Black has a somewhat cramped but solid position in this line. It’s not easy for white to overcome his defenses.
Editor’s note:
As a rule, modern strong grandmasters don’t castle in this position, instead playing 11...Nc5 (putting pressure on the e4 pawn) or 11...Rc8 (activating the rook, with a positional exchange sacrifice on c3 possible in many lines).
12.Qh3 Qc7 13.Rae1 Nc5 14.Bf2 d5
If black manages to play d6-d5 in the Sicilian, it usually means that all opening difficulties are over. So, after making his 14th move, Najdorf went for a walk around the hall, smiling contentedly.
Editor’s note:
In this position, 14...d5 is a mistake. One of the possible alternatives is the prophylactic 14...g6, as played in a number of subsequent games.
15.exd5 Nxd3 16.cxd3 Bxd5
16...Nxd5 is bad due to 17.Nxe6!
17.Nxd5 exd5 18.Nf5 Bc5 19.d4 Ba7 20.Bh4 Ne4
21.Rxe4! dxe4 22.Bf6!
White’s attack is now unstoppable. After
22...Qb6
22...gxf6 23.Qg4+
23.Bxg7 Rfe8 24.Be5 Qg6 25.Nh6+ Kf8 26.f5, the Argentinian grandmaster resigned.
After 26...Qg5 there’s 27.Nxf7! winning, while after 26...Qc6 white plays 27.Qh5 Re7 28.Qg5. (
Editor’s note:
In the last line, 28.Qg5 doesn’t work because of black’s reply 28...Rxe5–+. White should play 28.f6 instead, winning immediately.)
Mikhail Botvinnik’s play left a very good impression. He didn’t suffer from time trouble that had plagued him so much in the match. He managed to achieve that by quick opening play. It seemed like the ex-world champion had set some kind of schedule for spending time. Botvinnik again showed his superior endgame technique and great opening erudition. It was clear that he hadn’t lost confidence after his defeat in the match.
Botvinnik’s Revenge
And again, like just a year ago, we’re in Moscow, in the National Hotel. It’s almost ten o’clock. The draw for the return match starts in a few minutes.
Two weeks ago, the medical commission determined that the world champion’s health wouldn’t allow him to start the match as scheduled, on 15th March. The Council of the USSR Sports Society and Organization Union granted the request of the Latvian Chess Federation to start the match in mid-April.
But something unexpected happened. The world champion said that doctors weren’t prophets, and that they couldn’t predict how he would feel in a few weeks!
After that, I became completely convinced that Tal totally lacked any self-preservation instinct, and this could eventually lead to serious consequences.
I still tried to convince him to listen to the doctors; however, unlike Tal the world championship challenger, Tal the world champion didn’t listen to me. He wouldn’t budge.
“You should understand,” he assured me, “I’ve been so anxiously waiting for the chance to play Botvinnik again...”
The draw was held in old style: Stahlberg held a white and a black pawn in his closed fists. The world champion got black.
When grandmaster David Bronstein was asked who would win the return match, he replied, “The one who wins the first game.”
And so, on 15th March 1961, Botvinnik and Tal sat at the chess board again. This time, the games were held in the Variety Theater.
Of course, the result of just one game is not important in a marathon competition, but a win in the first round is encouraging, it makes you believe in yourself more.
The opponents make their first moves quickly. The game transposes from a Nimzo-Indian Defense into a line of the Ragozin System.
Botvinnik chooses a rather passive continuation, and Tal seems to be seizing the initiative.
The ex-world champion Max Euwe, who sat beside me, was perplexed. Where is Botvinnik’s renowned opening erudition? How did he manage to get a worse position with white?
The Tal fans are obvious to spot in the hall: they are beaming.
“So, it begins. Misha will show him!”
But Misha doesn’t “show him”. After some poor maneuvering, he gets a worse endgame.
No. 71
M. Botvinnik – M. Tal
1961, Moscow, World Championship Match, game 1
Here, black could still save the game with 30...Bf5! For instance, 31.Nd4 Bd7, then the black king heads to the center, and white can’t convert his small advantage.
However,
Tal played 30...Bd5 and quickly lost.
Editor’s note:
After Botvinnik’s
31.Nd4
, Tal, to prevent the threat 32.e4, was forced to play
31...c5
, and after
32.bxc5 bxc5 33.Nb5
, the white knight’s activity, coupled with black’s compromised pawn structure, became the decisive factor.
In his career up until then, he was capable of holding even tougher endgames, so this loss was an alarming symptom.
The second game. Botvinnik plays the Caro-Kann.
Before the start of the match, Tal half-joked that if Botvinnik “dared” to play the Caro-Kann, he’d develop his pieces according to the setup that he’d used successfully the previous year (Bc4 and Ne2) and “checkmate him quickly”. However, Botvinnik stopped white’s attack with his 9th move and equalized. Still, he made several mistakes in time trouble, and the game was adjourned in a position that looked won for Tal.
The next day, the newspapers reported: “When the game resumed, Botvinnik resigned after a few moves.”
So laconic! But Tal had to spend so much energy and work so hard to analyze this won ending! The analysis took almost all night and the morning of the next day. Here’s what Mikhail Tal tells us about this analysis.
No. 72
M. Tal – M. Botvinnik
1961, Moscow, World Championship Match, game 2
“There was no doubt that black would seal the move
41...Qa5
, because all other moves lost immediately.
For instance, 41...Nc3 42.Qd8+ Kh7 43.Qh4+ Kg8 44.a7.
41...Qa5
After 41...Qa5, white had an important choice. It’s easy to see that after 42.Qa7 b4 43.Qb8+ Kh7 44.a7 Nc7 white wins a piece, but black’s passed pawn was a great hurdle for converting the material advantage. There could follow 45.Qxc7 Qxc7 46.a8=Q b3 47.Qa3 Qc2 48.Qa4 Qc3 49.Qh4+ Kg8 50.Qd8+ Kh7 51.Qd3 Qb4, and white’s win is quite problematic.
Editor’s note:
The move 48...Qd1 (instead of Tal’s 48...Qc3) removes all doubts, for instance, 49.g3 e5 50.Qb5 (50.Kg2 Qd5+ 51.Kh2 b2 52.Qc2 Qd4 53.Bd3 b1=Q 54.Qxb1 Qxf2+ 55.Kh1 Qxg3=) 50...Qb1 51.Qd3 Qc2 52.Kg2 e4, and white can’t improve his position.
In our search for ways to win, we analyzed the natural move 42.a7 the most. (Interestingly, Botvinnik mostly focused on lines after 42.Qa7.)
And so,
42.a7 b4
(the only move that repels the threat 43.
B
xb5).
Here’s the initial position where white had to search for the winning move. It turns out that it’s hard for white to activate his queen. 43.Bb5 attracted our attention: 43...b3 doesn’t work due to 44.Qa4. But then it turned out that after 43.Bb5, black had 43...Nc7, and if 44.Bc6, then 44...b3 and it’s a draw, as white can’t win with 45.Qd8+ Kh7 46.a8=Q due to 46...Qe1+.
Alternatively, if instead of 44.Bc6, white plays 44.Qd8+ Kh7 45.a8=Q, winning a piece, then 45...Qxa8, and the black pawn can move again.
And so, if white wins a piece while the black pawn hasn’t moved beyond b4, then white should win without much technical difficulty.
Editor’s note:
Tal’s last assertion looks questionable and is not confirmed by computer analysis. In a similar vein, below Tal gives the line (after the game move 43.Bc4) 43...g5 44.g3 g6 45.Kh2 Kh7 46.Kg2 Kg8 47.Bb5 and writes that 47...Nb6 is bad, “because white wins a piece in the most beneficial situation” – without a doubt, he means 48.Qxb6 Qxb6 49.a8=Q+ here. But, despite several hours of analysis, the computer fails to show a way to win for white after the subsequent 49...Kg7 or 49...Kh7 – and if such positions are indeed impossible to win, then the adjourned position is drawn too!
Coming to this conclusion, we started to analyze the position after the quiet
43.Bc4
, which was the move I played. The moves 43...
K
h7 or 43...
K
f8 lead to the same position.
Editor’s note:
He means that after 43...Kh7 44.Bxd5 exd5 45.Qh4+ or 43...Kf8 44.Bxd5 exd5 45.Qh4 black is forced to continue 45...Kg8 (in the first case it’s the only legal move, while in the second it’s the only one that continues resistance), as a result of which both lines lead to the same position analyzed in the next sentence.) After 43...Kh7 44.Bxd5 exd5 45.Qh4, black has only one move – 45...Kg8.
Now, by playing 46.Qe7 Kh7 47.Qb7 Qa1+ 48.Kh2 Qe5+ 49.g3 Qe2 50.Qxf7 Qa6 (if 50...Qa2, then 51.h4 b3 52.h5 b2 53.Qxg6+ Kh8 54.Qe8+ Kh7 55.a8=Q Qxa8 56.Qxa8 b1=Q 57.Qxd5 with a won endgame for white) 51.Qe7 g5 (white threatened 52.Qh4+ and 53.Qd8+) 52.Qf7!, white wins.
And so, we found a way to exploit the weakening of black’s kingside, who now has no remedy against Qh5+ and Qe8+, or Qf8. In the case of 52...Kh6, 53.g4 is winning.
It’s clear that king moves won’t help black, so now we can analyze the other lines after 43.Bc4.
The queen’s best position is on a5, so we ignored moves such as 43...Qa3: white wins easily with 44.Bxd5 exd5 45.Qb6 Kh7 46.Qb8. Therefore, black can only make moves with his knight or pawns.
I. 43...g5. This move takes away the important h4 square from the queen; however, it also weakens the kingside.
Editor’s note:
Unfortunately, Tal’s subsequent analysis contains a number of inaccuracies that lead to erroneous evaluations. It would be impractical to point out all such moments – this would make the text, already heavily saturated with lines, even harder to read. So, we’ll show just two critical points:
A) As the reader shall see, Tal gives the line 44.g3 Kh7 45.h4 gxh4 etc. in his subsequent notes, coming to the conclusion that white should win. But instead of 45...gxh4 (which is a mistake), black saves the game with the study-like 45...g6!! (planning 46...Nb6; the immediate 45...Nb6? is bad due to 46.hxg5 Qxa7 47.Qh4+ Kg8 48.g6! Qa1+ 49.Kg2 Qf6 50.Qh7+ Kf8 51.Bb5!) 45...g6!!
46.hxg5 b3!! (luring the bishop onto a bad square) 47.Bxb3 Nb6 48.Bxe6 (48.Qxb6 Qxb6 49.a8=Q Qxb3 – this line shows the point of black’s move 46...b3) 48...Qe1+ 49.Kg2 Qxe6 50.Qxb6 Qxb6 51.a8=Q Qd4, and black holds easily, despite white’s extra pawn. The computer’s first line 46.Bb3 (instead of 46.hxg5) doesn’t win either – after the subsequent 46...Nb6 47.Qxb6 Qxb6 48.a8=Q gxh4 49.gxh4 (or 49.Qh1 Qd4 50.Qxh4+ Qxh4 51.gxh4 g5 52.hxg5 Kg6=) 49...Qd4, white cannot convert his material advantage.
B) After 44.g3 g6 45.Kh2 Kh7 46.Kg2
black also immediately achieves a draw with 46...b3!! (instead of 46...Kg8) 47.Bxb3 Nb6 48.Bxe6 (after 48.Qxb6 Qxb6, the bishop is hanging) 48...fxe6 49.Qxb6 Qxb6 50.a8=Q Kg7. So, instead of 45.Kh2, white has a much stronger move 45.Bb5, getting, after 45...Nb6 46.Qxb6 Qxb6 47.a8=Q+, an endgame with a piece for two pawns and the black pawn still on b4, which white wanted from the outset. That said, as we pointed out earlier, this endgame might be unwinnable after all!
Now back to Tal:
White can just play 44.g3, and black has nothing better than 44...g6 (after 44....Kh7, there’s 45.h4 gxh4 46.Qxh4+ Kg8 47.Bxd5 exd5) 45.Kh2! The idea of this move will soon become clear.
Black should play 45...Kh7 and meet 46.Kg2 with 46...Kg8, after which 47.Bb5! wins.
For instance, 47...b3 48.Qa4; or 47...Nc7 48.Bc6 Kh7 49.Qf6! (49.Qd7 is weaker because of 49...Kg7). If now 49...Qxa7, then 50.Qxf7+ with the subsequent Be4, and white’s attack is unstoppable. 49...Qf5 can’t save black either after 50.Qe7.
There’s a question why white had to make two king moves. If the black king is on h7, white’s plan doesn’t work, because after 43...g5 44.g3 g6 45.Kh2 Kh7 46.Bb5
black has the reply 46...b3, and the endgame after 47.Qa4 Qxa4 48.Bxa4 b2 49.Bc2 Nc7 is not completely clear (
Editor’s note:
Analysis shows that this position is drawn). So, the black king should be on the eighth rank.
And what’s the difference between the white king’s position on h2 or g2?
Let’s return to 43...g5 44.g3 g6 45.Kh2 Kh7 46.Kg2 Kg8 47.Bb5 Kh7 (47...Nb6 is bad because white wins a piece in the most beneficial situation [in the line 48.Qxb6 Qxb6 49.a8=Q+ see the editor’s note three pages earlier]) 48.Bc6 Nb6. If the white king were instead on h2 now:
(to the line)
the position would be drawn because of 49.Qxb6 Qxb6, threatening f2.
If the king is on g2, however:
white wins with 49.Qxb6 Qxb6 50.a8=Q, because black has no time to play 50...b3 due to 51.Qb7. After 51...Qxb7 52.Bxb7 f5 53.Ba6 white’s victory is assured.
That’s the way to win in the line 43...g5.
II.
43...f6
.
Botvinnik chose this move. Black wants to bring his king closer to the passed pawn, but he weakens his kingside. White, without wasting time on prophylactic moves, immediately played
44.Bb5
. After
44...b3 45.Qa4 Botvinnik resigned.
The key idea of the move 44.Bb5 is clearly shown in the main line – 44...Nc7 45.Bd3! f5 (if 45...Kh7, then 46.Qh4+ Kg8 47.Bxg6) 46.Bc4. Now the white queen controls all the dark squares, and so black’s position is hopeless.
Can we say then that the adjourned position couldn’t have been saved anyway? It’s hard to answer this question. After 43...Nc7 44.Qd8+ Kh7 45.a8=Q Qxa8 46.Qxc7 Qa1+ 47.Kh2 Qc1!, black got good counterplay. 47...Qc3 is worse due to 48.Qf4 b3 49.Qh4+ Kg8 50.Qd8+ Kh7 51.Qd3.
Had Botvinnik played 43...Nc7, white would have needed to prepare to win the piece with 44.g3 and Kg2, but black’s kingside wouldn’t have been compromised. To be honest, we couldn’t find a forced win in the last line, but after losing a piece, it would be hard for black to avoid defeat.”
Despite this important win, Tal’s mood didn’t improve. At that time, we received an additional opening card index from Riga, covering more than 5,000 games. Looking through it, we found the game Uusi – Makogonov from the Soviet team championship, where black successfully tried the defense 9...Nd5 (precisely the move Botvinnik played in the second game).
Tal never said a word, but I felt that he was upset. Playing in the Stockholm tournament and a simultaneous display with Czechoslovakian youngsters several months before the return match was of course useful for training, but it couldn’t replace deep theoretical preparation.
In the third game, Tal got a good position, but missed his opponent’s unexpected move, and Botvinnik gained a substantial positional advantage. The world champion defended valiantly, but he couldn’t save the game. That was an impressive Botvinnik victory in a logical, positional style.
In the fourth game, Tal gave his opponent complete freedom in the center and launched a quick pawn onslaught on the queenside.
Grandmaster Boris Spassky said in the press center, “Misha should be punished for such anti-positional play.”
International master Lev Aronin disagreed: “Tal is bold, and I like his original plan!”
This was the first game of the return match where Tal got a position to his taste. But this time, Botvinnik played very precisely. With a subtle, deeply considered exchange sacrifice, he repelled the attack and went on the offensive himself. Tal’s position noticeably worsened.
In general, Botvinnik didn’t suffer from time trouble in the return match, but in this game he did lack time to think and failed to find the strongest move. As a result, Tal managed to salvage the game.
After game 4, Tal thought that Botvinnik’s strategic weapon, like in the previous match, wouldn’t play a decisive role. However, the very next game showed that these hopes were unfounded. The ex-world champion again imposed a quiet, maneuvering struggle on Tal. The position was approximately equal, but Tal played without inspiration, got into time trouble (he had four minutes left for 16 moves) and ultimately lost a pawn. Still, he managed to avoid defeat in the resumption.
In the sixth game, the young world champion gained a promising position. Then his opponent equalized. In a position where neither player was able to upset the balance without dire consequences for themselves, the grandmasters agreed to a draw.
In the seventh game, Tal deployed the Nimzo-Indian Defense as black. We anticipated that Botvinnik would play the Samisch Attack and prepared a rare line. After nine moves, a well-known theoretical position occurred.
No. 73
M. Botvinnik – M. Tal
1961, Moscow, World Championship Match, game 7
Here, white usually played 10.e5, and after 10...Ng8, continued 11.Ne2 Qd7 12.Kf2 Nc6 with the subsequent 0-0-0. Chances are roughly equal in this case.
But Botvinnik, after a short think, played
10.Bg5!
After
10...h6
, there followed the stunning
11.Qa4+!
, and
Tal couldn’t equalize. He resigned
on move 33.
Late that night, when we analyzed the game, Tal was wondering, “Did Botvinnik anticipate that I’d play this half-forgotten line? It’s the first opening ‘knockout’ in my life!”
Of course, it was unpleasant to see that the line we had specifically prepared for the return match hit us back like a boomerang.
“I saw the true Tal’s play again,” the ex-world champion Max Euwe wrote to me from Amsterdam after game 8.
No. 74, Caro-Kann Defense
M. Tal – M. Botvinnik
1961, Moscow, World Championship Match, game 8
1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 c5
3...Bf5 is considered the strongest move, but Botvinnik avoids this exhaustively-studied continuation, preferring to interpret the position in the spirit of the French Defense. When he finally risked playing 3...Bf5 in game 10, Tal caught him by surprise with his ultra-original move 4.h4!?
4.dxc5 e6 5.Qg4
Editor’s note:
In modern practice, white usually plays 5.Be3, 5.a3, or 5.Nf3.
5...Nc6
Editor’s note:
5...h5 is good here, for instance, 6.Qg3 h4 7.Qg4 Nh6 8.Bxh6 Rxh6 with unclear play.
6.Nf3 Qc7 7.Bb5 Bd7 8.Bxc6 Qxc6 9.Be3 Nh6
10.Bxh6
Tal went for this trade without hesitation, giving his opponent the “proud” bishop pair. The two bishops usually yield a certain positional advantage. By playing 10.Bxh6, Tal committed to a concrete strategic plan where the white knights play a major role.
10...gxh6 11.Nbd2 Qxc5 12.c4!
It’s dangerous to take on c4, because the white knight might get to e4, targeting d6 and f6. White also puts the c-file to good use.
12...0-0-0
Editor’s note:
12...dxc4 13.0-0 Bc6 (or in a different order – 12...Bc6 13.0-0 dxc4) was much more solid, for instance, (12...dxc4 13.0-0 Bc6)14.Ne4 Bxe4 15.Qxe4 Rc8 16.Qxb7 Bg7 17.Rfc1 0-0 18.Qe4 Qd5, with a roughly equal position.
13.0-0 Kb8 14.Rfd1 Qb6
15.Qh4
Controlling the dark squares and attacking the h6 pawn.
15...a5
Black prevents b2-b4, but seriously weakens his queenside. 15...Rg8 or 15...Rc8 were worth considering.
16.Rac1 Rg8 17.Nb3! a4
Here, black could have also put up more resistance with 17...Rc8. After the game move, white’s attack develops very quickly.
18.c5! Qc7 19.Nbd4 Rc8
19...Bxc5 was dangerous due to 20.b4 axb3 21.Nxb3 b6 22.a4!
20.b4 axb3 21.axb3 Qd8
Even the queen trade doesn’t save black from a deadly attack.
22.Qxd8 Rxd8 23.b4 Rg4 24.b5 Rc8 25.c6! Be8 26.Rc2 Bg7 27.Ra1 Bxe5 28.Nxe5 Rxd4 29.Nd7+! Black resigned.
After 29...Kc7, there’s 30.b6+ Kd8 31.cxb7, while after 29...Bxd7, white plays 30.cxd7 Rd8 31.Rc8+! Rxc8 32.Ra8+.
Botvinnik was still in the lead, but it looked like Tal was slowly recovering his form.
Suddenly, the world champion had to deal with another dangerous opponent – flu. The ninth game didn’t take place on schedule – it was only played a week later.
After Botvinnik’s first move 1.c4, Tal decided to use a system recommended by Paul Keres, with an aggressive early queen lunge.
Before the match, we decided to avoid excessively sharp lines with black, but this time the world champion wanted to turn things around. Such a strategy wasn’t entirely safe, but, on the other hand, it did bring Tal his greatest successes.
Events unfolded in a very unpleasant way for the Riga player. Botvinnik’s seventh move showed that even in this rare line he had prepared a novelty. Tal fell victim to a theoretical surprise again!
Leaving the kingside pieces undeveloped, Tal launched a risky queenside attack. The ex-world champion easily repelled it and already had a won position by move 16.
After play resumed, Tal tried to create some complications, but nothing came of that: the score turned 5.5-3.5.
Tal’s opening play in the tenth game was quite esoteric. He made his first seven moves with pawns! “Tal probably forgot that he could move pieces in chess as well,” grandmaster Tolush joked.
Indeed, Tal’s position looked quite strange. “Reckless”, “Bad theoretical preparation”, I heard from every direction. Only Bronstein said with a smile, “Original idea!”
Tal’s strategic plan wasn’t as flawed as many commentators thought. This is evidenced, among other things, by the fact that Botvinnik didn’t risk repeating the opening in games 14 and 16. Although the strategic plan wasn’t erroneous, Tal’s two “experimental” moves, ninth and tenth, were. They ruined everything. Those were perhaps Tal’s weakest opening moves in the whole match. Botvinnik exploited his opponent’s mistakes in quite an instructive way and added another important point to his score.
I must admit that I was surprised when Tal, after a short think, suddenly chose the Slav Defense in game 11. Botvinnik could have gone for the exchange variation that led to a symmetrical position.
It was clear that Tal needed some rest, and he wanted to take a small break. But purposefully playing for a draw is a special skill. Tal lacks that skill, and I hope that the chess world will forgive this flaw of his.
Tal got a difficult position out of the opening and lost again. After the game, Botvinnik told us that he’d analyzed this line 17 years earlier...
By now, Botvinnik had increased his lead to four points. The gap was already big, but Tal still had some hopes – there were 13 games left to play!
In game 12, Botvinnik played the French Defense for the first time in the match. Tal attacked energetically, and his win was quite convincing.
What conclusion could we reach after the first half of the match? How to explain Tal’s collapses?
With a deeply thought-out strategy, Botvinnik managed to avoid positions that were rich in mutual tactical opportunities, those positions where Tal’s combinational talent could fully manifest itself. Tellingly, in many games, Tal got into adverse strategic situations while still in the opening.
Game 13 was a shining example of Botvinnik’s strategic mastery. He didn’t allow his opponent to fan the flames of complications.
No. 75, King’s Indian Defense
M. Botvinnik – M. Tal
1961, Moscow, World Championship Match, game 13
After
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.f3 0-0 6.Be3 e5
, the following position occurred.
Botvinnik played
7.dxe5
The queen trade doesn’t promise white much, but it’s psychologically sound: it’s hard for black to organize counterplay. In other circumstances, the capture on e5 would mean a refusal to play for an advantage in the opening, an intention to play for a draw. But each draw got Botvinnik closer to his aim!
7...dxe5 8.Qxd8 Rxd8 9.Nd5 Nxd5 10.cxd5
This position had occurred in the game Boleslavsky – Najdorf (Candidates Tournament 1953).
10...c6 11.Bc4 b5
In the aforementioned game, Najdorf played 11...cxd5 12.Bxd5 Nc6 and achieved a draw relatively easily. But Tal can’t be satisfied with such a result, so he tries to complicate the game.
12.Bb3 Bb7 13.0-0-0 c5
The struggle becomes more complicated, but white now has a strong passed pawn in the center.
Editor’s note:
In subsequent games, black usually played 13...cxd5, and then, after 14.Bxd5 Bxd5 15.Rxd5 Rxd5 16.exd5 Nd7, black is all right.
14.Bc2! Nd7 15.Ne2 Bf8 16.Nc3 a6
This seemingly logical move almost turns out to be the decisive mistake. It was better to play 16...b4 and then Nb6.
Editor’s note:
If white meets 16...b4 with 17.Na4, then, of course, not 17...Nb6 (this would lose the c5 pawn), but, for instance, 17...c4 with a roughly equal position. After 17.Nb5, black should avoid 17...Nb6 as well (white has an unpleasant reply 18.d6) and play 17...a5 instead, with the idea of a5-a4 and Ra5.
17.b3! Rac8 18.Bd3! Nb6 19.Be2! Rd6
The rook is a bad blockading piece, but the b6 knight needed some protection.
20.Kb2! f5
Black is trying to activate his rook, but he weakens the e5 pawn.
21.Rc1 Rf6
22.a4! bxa4 23.bxa4 a5 24.Kc2 c4 25.Rb1 Bb4 26.Na2! Bc5 27.Bxc5 Rxc5 28.Nc3 Bc8 29.Rb2
Editor’s note:
29.f4! is much stronger – after the subsequent 29...Nd7 30.fxe5 Nxe5 31.Rb5 Rxb5 32.axb5, it’s very hard for black to defend.
29...Bd7?
After 29...fxe4 30.fxe4!, white would still have needed some effort to win the game. Now, black just falls apart.
30.Rhb1 Bxa4+ 31.Nxa4 Nxa4 32.Rb8+ Kg7 33.R1b7+ Rf7 34.d6 Rxb7 35.Rxb7+ Kf6 36.Rxh7 Rc8 37.d7 Rd8 38.Bxc4 Nc5 39.Rf7+ Kg5 40.Bb5 fxe4 41.fxe4 Black resigned.
In game 14, Tal got a dangerous initiative, but Botvinnik managed to hold. The game was drawn.
An unfortunate mistake cost Tal a full point in game 15.
No. 76
M. Botvinnik – M. Tal
1961, Moscow, World Championship Match, game 15
Tal, who had black, played
28...Rd7?
“I wrote down 28...Rc7 on the score sheet, but mistakenly put the rook on d7,” he explained after the game. “When my opponent played 29.g5!, I played 29...h6 automatically, because I was totally sure that my rook was on c7.”
28...Rd7?
There followed
29.g5! h6? 30.gxh6 Bxh6 31.Ng4
It turns out that due to the threat
N
f6, black has to part with his bishop:
31...Bg7 32.Nf6+ Bxf6 33.Bxf6. Botvinnik won on move 63.
Botvinnik misplayed the opening in game 16, and Tal got good attacking chances.
“It will end in ten moves,” the spectators decided.
But Tal played with hesitation, and Botvinnik, who sacrificed a pawn, managed to organize some counterplay. In a complicated major-piece endgame, Botvinnik played very precisely and drew the game on the 90th move, after an eleven-hour battle.
Each draw got Botvinnik closer to the goal, so Tal had to go for complications at any cost. Game 17 is an example of such an all-in approach. Tal turned a completely equal position into a lost one. However, Botvinnik’s time trouble helped Misha: the challenger made several mistakes, and Tal managed to win in the resumption.
Tal was always eager to try some unbeaten paths, but now he decided to improvise. In game 18, the world champion made moves that no grandmaster could understand. Even Tal himself couldn’t explain them in the post-game analysis. To cap it off, the Riga player also blundered a pawn. The next day, he resigned without resuming the game.
This was Tal’s worst game in both matches against Botvinnik.
It seemed incredible that, after such painful defeats, Tal still had the strength to continue the match. After a ten-hour battle, Botvinnik lost the nineteenth game.
In game 20, Tal slowly outplayed his opponent.
No. 77
M. Tal – M. Botvinnik
1961, Moscow, World Championship Match, game 20
After the game resumed, there followed:
42...Ne6 43.Ke3 Rd7! 44.b4 Kf7 45.Nc5?
The waiting move 45.Rc1! would have won the game. If 45...Ke7, then 46.Nc5! Nxc5 47.bxc5 Ra8 48.Rg1! Kf7 49.e6+!, or after 45...Ra8 there was 46.Nc5 Nxc5 47.Rxc5 with the subsequent 48.a4 and b4-b5.
45...Nxc5 46.bxc5 Ra8!
We missed this move in our analysis.
Later, Botvinnik made a mistake, and the game was adjourned for a second time.
Tal sealed the move
89.Ka2
.
Our plan seemed to lead to a win: 89...Rb5 90.a7 Ra5+ 91.Kb3 Kb7 92.Rf8. Here, we automatically continued 92...Rxa7 93.Rf7+ Kb8 94.Rxf5, and after 94...Ra1, there’s 95.Kb4 Rd1 96.Ka5 and Kb6, winning. A more complicated, but still won endgame arose after 92...Kxa7.
Editor’s note:
In the line 92...Rxa7 93.Rf7+, instead of the erroneous 93...Kb8, the correct continuation is 93...Ka6 94.Rxf5 Kb5, getting enough counterplay, for instance: 95.Rf8 Ra8 (black can also put the rook on e7, g7, h7 or a1, activating it) 96.Rf7 (capturing on a8 is stalemate) 96...Ra7 97.Rf6 Ra4 with a draw.
The first moves were made quickly:
89.Ka2, 89...Rb5 90.a7
Editor’s note:
90.Rf8 won, for instance: 90...Ra5+ 91.Kb3 Rxa6 92.Rxf5 Kd7 93.Rf6 Ra1 94.f5 Rd1 95.Kc3 Rc1+ 96.Kd2 Rf1 97.Rf7+ Kd8 98.Kc3 Rb1 99.f6 Rf1 100.Kb4 Ke8 101.Rh7 Rxf6 102.Ka5 Rf4 103.Kb6 Rxd4 104.Kxc6 Rg4 105.Rd7 d4 106.Kc7+–
90...Ra5+ 91.Kb3 Kb7 92.Rf8 Rb5+!
The first unexpected move. Tal quickly played
93.Ka4
, not noticing that after
93...Kxa7 94.Rxf5 Rb1
[which was played]
95.Rf7+ Ka6! 96.Rc7 Rb4+! 97.Kxb4, the black king is stalemated.
A draw was now unavoidable. [The game ended in a
draw
after 121 moves.]
Meanwhile, 93.Kc3 still gave white some practical winning chances.
The last ray of hope was extinguished. The score was 12-8. There was no doubt that Botvinnik would score the necessary half-point in one of the next four games.
In game 21, Tal tried to complicate play for one last time, but Botvinnik launched an attack himself and won.
Winning the return match 13-8, Mikhail Botvinnik regained the title of the world’s strongest chess player. With his convincing win, he wrote a new, brilliant page in the book of the history of world championships. Regaining the title was a triumph of the will, the result of a well considered training system, deep psychological approach, incredible strategic mastery and precise technique.
(back to the text)
If the white king were instead on h2 now:
the position would be drawn because of 49.Qxb6 Qxb6, threatening f2.
Afterword
With his brilliant victories in difficult tournaments, Mikhail Tal proved that he was one of the strongest chess players of our time. He successfully progressed through the numerous qualification stages, overtaking famous grandmasters, and earned the right to face the world champion. He won the ensuing battle convincingly.
Yet just a year passed, and Tal suffered an equally crushing defeat from the seemingly vanquished opponent.
Discussing the reasons for Tal’s loss, V. Vasilyev wrote in the
Yunost
magazine:
“As sad as it sounds, Mikhail Tal, who always stood out as a pointedly humble man, who was always reverent towards his grandmaster colleagues, lost his ability to soberly, critically evaluate himself, his own strength and his opponents’ strength after winning the world champion’s title. Tal’s friends worriedly and then anxiously saw that he stopped listening to advice, even if it was given by renowned people of the chess world. The constant victories dulled his sense of danger.”
These harsh words correctly describe the reason for the catastrophe that the young world champion suffered in the return match.
Indeed, Tal lost his sense of danger – but wasn’t it facilitated by the atmosphere of adoration created around the young world champion, the excessive praise thrown around by his overexcited fans?
“Genius”, “crazy boldness”, “the ability to play without regard for the logic of the position” – that’s only a small part of the things said about Tal!
Didn’t all those admiring songs of praise contribute to Tal’s feeling of complacency and recklessness?
Losing the return match was a timely, severe life lesson for Tal.
When Tal returned to the hotel after game 21, he sat wearily in a chair. He had a lot to think about, many things became much clearer. The thought that he had deeply disappointed everyone whose care and support he felt at every step weighed heavily on his mind.
The first person who tried to help Tal with friendly advice and restore his self-belief was... Botvinnik! After the last game ended, Botvinnik invited his opponent to dinner. Raising his glass, he said, “Yuri Gagarin flew into space after long, intense training. If Mikhail Tal follows Gagarin’s example in this regard, I’m sure he’ll reach cosmic heights!”
Several days later, at the closing ceremony, Botvinnik continued his thoughts: “If Tal manages to ‘program’ himself and prepare for tournaments more carefully, he’ll probably be unstoppable.”
Many didn’t pay much heed to these words. Everyone knew that Botvinnik would remain a tough opponent. Would Tal be able to regain his self-belief and reach the right conclusions from his loss?
Tal put in only a modest performance in the European team championship, sharing third-fourth place, but at the big international tournament in Bled he again shone with brilliant play. The strongest grandmasters of the world took part: Petrosian, Keres, Fischer – the most likely world championship candidates. Tal won the tournament.
This was a brilliant victory made possible by colossal will-power. Most importantly, he overcame himself.
In Bled, Tal displayed the diversity of his talent. He crushed Fridrik Olafsson, Bruno Parma and Ludek Pachman in a sharp attacking style, and made Miguel Najdorf, Borislav Ivkov and Arthur Bisguier resign after a subtle positional, maneuvering struggle.
The victory in Bled showed again that Mikhail Tal, a true chess artist, remains one of the world’s strongest grandmasters.
I remember the words of one English journalist who said after Botvinnik’s world championship win in 1948: “We respect the new world champion deeply, but we aren’t sure that Botvinnik would have become such a brilliant chess player if he lived in another country.”
These words are fully applicable to the 1960 world champion as well. No other country provides such a wide array of opportunities for the comprehensive development of human skills and flourishing of great talent as the country that builds communism.
And Mikhail Tal’s creative path is a shining example of that.
