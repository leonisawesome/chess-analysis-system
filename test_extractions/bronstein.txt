A WORD FROM THE TRANSLATOR
Surely, this is no ordinary chess book that you hold, dear Reader. Myself, I have read chess books that were entertaining, and those that were instructive; some that were historic, and a few that were downright bad. But never have I encountered a book written with such powerful style and such obvious passion for the game.
The passion is infectious. The translation you hold is the final product of ten years’ work and four revisions — and still, I feel that it wanted more effort...so you can see the fascination Bronstein’s book had for its translator! If my translation can infect you, the Reader, with half of that fascination, then it will be a job well done.
I must thank Jack O’Keefe for his meticulous proofreading and priceless editorial work.

INSTEAD OF A PREFACE
As I began work on my first chess book, I put myself mentally in the reader’s place, recalling the excitement with which I used to open each new chess book, hoping to find vital thinking there, clear words, and a wondrous tale of the art of chess. I absorbed a great deal from books, and to this day I cherish the memory of the best of them.
Books about chess tournaments belong to a special class of literature, which would seem at first blush to be rather restrictive of the author’s creative possibilities, since he must write, not on themes of his own choosing, but about chess material already created. But this is not quite true. The author is free to treat the games any way he wishes, to make generalizations, and to uncover the ideas and plans actually executed, as well as those that could have occurred in the actual or some other game.
The book of a strong tournament is more than just a games collection. When its participants are the world’s strongest players, then the games are mutually interdependent, and brimming with ideas, which crystallize and develop as the event progresses. Thus, the tournament as a whole represents a step forward in the development of chess creativity. We may take as examples of such tournaments the events at Hastings 1895, St Petersburg 1914, New York 1924, Moscow 1935, and Groningen 1946. Beyond doubt, Zurich-Neuhausen 1953 deserves a place among them.
In working on this book, I started from the premise that every full-bodied game of chess is an artistic endeavor, arising out of a struggle between two masters of equal rank. The kernel of a game of chess is the creative clash of plans, the battle of chess ideas, which takes on its highest form in the middlegame.
This book examines a number of standard positions which occur as a result of the collision of plans; also examined are such strategic concepts as darksquare weaknesses, the advantage of the two bishops, play and counterplay on opposite wings, the relative strengths of the pieces, overprotection, and so forth. Such elements of the struggle as intuition, resourcefulness, and determination are discussed too.
The games of a tournament of grandmasters bring the reader into the creative circle of the contemporary leaders of chess, showing him the rise and fall of battle as well as the manner in which a game of chess is created. It is the author’s intention to discourse upon the least explored and most interesting stage of the game: the middlegame, and the way it is handled by today s grandmasters. That is the basic aim of this book.
The author has tried to avoid weighing down his book with variations. Variations can be interesting, if they show the beauty of chess; they become useless when they exceed the limits of what a man can calculate; and they are a real evil when they are substituted for the study and clarification of positions in which the outcome is decided by intuition, fantasy and talent.
Along with this, it was my hope that the player who read this book would raise himself thereby to a rather higher level of playing strength.
The reader will see errors, too, in the games of this tournament; but he will not be too severe in his judgment of the masters if he pictures to himself the peculiar nature of the chess struggle. At the board there sits a living person, with all his everyday thoughts and worries, sometimes far removed from chess. While selecting his plan, or even his next move, he cannot help thinking about his standing in the tournament, remembering yesterday s result, looking at other games. A game is not an analysis: everything must be worked out in one’s head, without moving the pieces, without consulting a book or asking advice from anyone... The grandmaster thinks and thinks — one last look at the clock — “Time to decide; I’ll risk it!” — and the knight goes to e5. Of course it’s easy, a whole year later, after studying all of the analyses and spending days on the position, to tell the reader, with absolute certainty: A mistake; the careful Ne1 was to be preferred...”
It may be that mistakes will turn up in my analyses and evaluations as well, although I have tried to keep them to a minimum. It is my hope that the reader will be indulgent, and help me to correct them.
It is with trepidation, then, that I submit my work to the judgment of the readers. I will consider my ends achieved if the contents of this book expand the reader’s chess horizon, increase his mastery of the game, give him some idea of the state of the art, and help him more fully to value — and still more to love — the depths of chess.
PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION
Now that my book is ready for its second edition, I would like to explain today what I had to pass over in the preface to the first edition four years ago. The work I submitted to the readers’ judgment at that time was a work which had little in common with the commentaries usually seen in the chess press. “Rotework” is a thing abhorrent to art and literature alike; thus, it should be still less acceptable in chess, which actually falls somewhere in an intermediate zone between art and literature. I do not wish to say anything against the numerous tournament and reference books that are being published, but for some years now a considerable decline has been noticed in the appetite of chessplayers for this type of literature, and yesterday’s insatiable demand has slackened. Under these circumstances, how would the public accept a large and unfortunately rather expensive tournament book, such as this one?
I had no wish to become a variations-monger; nor did I want the role of annotator-cum-guide. I felt that the author’s ideas and conclusions should form the basis of this book, with the moves played in each game serving to annotate them, as it were. I tried to let the book’s contents display the richness and limitless expanse of chess ideas, and to let the format resemble that of a literary work.
To judge from all the accepted indicators, the author appears to have accomplished his purpose, at least in part: the book sold out very quickly, and the reviews were favorable. Most valuable to me, however, were the many letters and opinions I received from readers (and I regret not having answered nearly enough of them). There I found, along with justified criticism of my book’s shortcomings, approval of the basic principles by which it was written. Those letters have been the finest possible reward for my labors, and I should like to take this opportunity to offer my heartfelt thanks to all who wrote me. I should like especially to thank Peter Romanovsky for his detailed review (helpful to readers and the author alike) which appeared in “Shakhmaty v SSSR”.
I was happy to agree to the publishers’ suggestion of a second edition; I intended to excise all obsolete and unimportant materials, to develop other material a bit more fully, and to expand the preface to reflect the most recent developments in the world of chess.
Thus, this second edition devotes a great deal less space to text, in games which did not serve my purpose of uncovering and describing the ideas of the art of chess. This applies especially to games from the later rounds, when the final standings of the tournament had already been largely determined, and the tension had slackened somewhat. Additionally, two or three errors in analysis, discovered by the readers and the author, have been corrected; the proofreading has been upgraded, and some diagrams revised.
I would like to close this segment with the hope that in the future my chessplaying audience will continue to aid the author in his work with their alert criticism, as well as their words of praise.
Since this is a book devoted mainly to the middle phase of the game of chess, it might be appropriate to begin with a few words about the evolution of opening ideas and the modern openings repertoire.
In former times — shall we say, the latter half of the preceding century — a game generally opened with the king’s pawn, to which Black would, in the majority of cases, reply 1...e7-e5. Such defenses as the Sicilian and the French were also employed, of course, but less frequently. With some exceptions, over half of the games played in any tournament would be open games, and sometimes a much greater percentage than that. At the close of the last century and the beginning of the present one, the closed games for White and the semi-open games for Black became very popular. Thus, in the Cambridge Springs tournament of 1904, the Queen s Gambit was the most common opening, with the Ruy Lopez second and the Sicilian third. The Indian defenses also began to appear in the tournaments of the 1890’s and 1900’s: these were the harbingers of new ideas.
The 1920’s witnessed the almost total disappearance of the open games, with the exception of the Ruy Lopez, from important tournaments, and the rise of the Queen’s Gambit and other Queen’s Pawn games. White’s success with the Queen’s Gambit and the Ruy led gradually to the popularization of the asymmetrical defensive systems: the Indian against 1.d2-d4, and the Sicilian against 1.e2-e4. This was a very fruitful period for the development of opening ideas. The victories of the young grandmasters were closely bound up with their discovery of new openings: the Nimzo-Indian, Reti’s Opening, Grunfeld’s Defense, Alekhine’s Defense.
At the strong double-round tournament at Bled 1931, which included Alekhine, Bogolyubov, Nimzovich, Vidmar, Flohr, Tartakover, Spielmann and Maroczy, among others, 77 Queen’s Gambits and other Queen’s Pawn games were played; of these, White won 29, and Black only 13. In the same event, 21 games used Indian Defenses, of which White could win only 2, while losing 14. Is in any wonder that, in the era that followed, encompassing the 1930’s and 1940’s, fewer and fewer Queen’s Gambits would be seen? The careers of many Soviet and non-Soviet players owed a great deal to the creation and development of new systems in the King’s Indian and Sicilian, as well as in the Nimzo-Indian and Grunfeld Defenses. Today, one may separate all openings, Black and White, into three major groupings.
In the first grouping, both sides follow classical principles, developing pieces, occupying space, creating a pawn center, avoiding weaknesses, etc. This is the shape of the struggle in the great majority of variations of the Queen’s Gambit, Ruy Lopez, French, and some systems of the Sicilian and Nimzo-Indian Defenses. Black knows that in these variations, especially in symmetrical positions, the advantage of the first move counts heavily, and he faces a long and patient struggle for equality. He has few winning chances, but if he works hard and plays cautiously, he may get a draw. The results of the World Championship match between Capablanca and Alekhine may be taken as typical for such openings. Of the thirty-four games of that match, thirty-three opened with the queen’s pawn; twenty-five games were drawn, White won six, and Black two. Masters nowadays tend to avoid such openings, shunning symmetrical setups in favor of defenses which offer counterchances.
Thus we come to the second group of openings, in which one side follows classical principles, while the other side consciously flouts a few, in order to obtain active play for his pieces, or an attack on the enemy pawn center, or sometimes simply for the sake of complicating. Such are the main lines of the King s Indian, Sicilian, Grunfeld and Nimzo-Indian, and some forcing lines of the Queen’s Gambit.
To the third group we may assign those openings in which White uses the opening phase not to occupy, but to control, the center squares, avoiding early definition of the pawn structure, and retaining maximum flexibility, while preparing for a war of maneuver. While this is going on, White is ready to stir up complications at an appropriate moment, or — should he secure some positional plus — to boil the game down to a technical stage. This group comprises the Closed Variation of the Sicilian, a number of lines in the Reti, the English, the King’s Indian Reversed, and a few others.
It should be noted here that giving an opening a name does not automatically set the course of the opening struggle. For example: in the Queen’s Gambit, one may play the Orthodox Defense, which is a typical form of the struggle on a classical footing. But one may also play Botvinnik’s line, or the risky “Peruvian” variation, with forcing play and counterchances for Black. The Queen’s Indian is not one of the symmetrical openings, but it does not give Black any real counterchances at all. And the Nimzo-Indian, one of the most outstanding and hardiest of defenses the “Hypermodern” school of the 1920’s ever produced, allows a flexible transition either to positional schemes or to sharp variations.
These changes in our conception of the opening closely paralleled the development of chess ideas in general. The Queen’s Gambit s greatest popularity coincided with the period when chess was completely dominated by the principles of the positional school. With all the good these principles have done, their one major shortcoming must be pointed out: the evaluation of positions by externals alone. In the eyes of Tarrasch’s disciples — and he was the propagandist of Steinitz’ ideas — such factors as a backward pawn, or a powerful pawn center, or an advantage in development, were decisive, both in the evaluation of one’s own position and in setting up a plan of action. “If one piece stands poorly, the whole game stands poorly,” said Tarrasch. The principles of the positional school, expressed in simple instructional form by Tarrasch, became inviolable axioms of chess to many of his contemporaries. And thus arose the misconception, which persists to this day, of the so-called “consistent” game, in which one player carries out, from beginning to end, his logical plan, almost as if he were demonstrating a theorem of geometry.
In the annotations to such an “ideal” game, one player always appears as the keeper of principle, the other as its transgressor. The “good” player then accumulates positional advantages and places them in a vault, much as if he were saving to buy a motorcycle. Having accumulated the proper amount, he then launches a combinative attack, winding it up with an instructive mate, or with a still more instructive win of the exchange. And just what, you may ask, was his opponent doing all this time? Why, gazing phlegmatically at his backward pawns and poorly-placed pieces, shrugging his shoulders, and then finally: “Black resigns.”
I doubt if it needs to be demonstrated that such games never occur between two grandmasters of equal ability, and that the annotators — a role generally assumed by the winner — turned what they wished to be into what actually happened.
The views of the positional school held sway in chess for a long time, but their weak side came to light in the 1920’s. As the Queen’s Gambit began to fade from the openings lists, so the names of Nimzovich, Reti, Tartakover and other masters began to appear more and more frequently at the top of tournament crosstables, while these players came out strongly against one-sided understanding and exaggeration of the role of positional principles.
Around 1935, the young masters of our country made their international debut, with Botvinnik at their head; later, they were to advance to the forefront of the world’s players. Their continuing successes gave some observers the impression of a Soviet school of chess some sort of aggregate of identical chess ideas and views. I don’t find this to be entirely true. As a matter of fact, the Soviet family of chess masters includes players of the most diverse styles. For example, Spassky and Petrosian, to judge from their styles of play and differing conceptions of the game, are as unlike one another as were Spielmann and Schlechter; and Tal as is far removed from Botvinnik as Lasker was from Capablanca.
Now, what sort of ideas characterize the 1950’s? What contribution did this tournament in Switzerland make to the development of-these ideas? And what is to be the direction of further progress in chess?
First, let us note the great erudition of chessplayers who have absorbed the experience of previous generations, allowing them now to fight with still more courage, forethought, fantasy and risk — all based on sober assessment of the pros and cons of the intended operation.
Our understanding of positional play has matured immeasurably. Where Tarrasch taught us to avoid weaknesses in our own position while striving to create them in our opponent’s position, to accumulate small advantages, to occupy open lines, and never to begin an attack without sufficient grounds, today things are sometimes done altogether differently. We might give ourselves weak spots and weak pawns, in order to distract our opponent; give up open lines, in order to save the rooks for other, more promising plans; or mount an attacking demonstration, in order to hide our real intentions.
The number of standard defensible positions, which every chessplayer knows he can fall back on in case of need, has also grown by leaps and bounds. We now find that many positions which were formerly considered lost can be defended successfully, even actively; but this requires, firstly: a tense game of calculation, and secondly: the ability to perceive the proper moment to abandon the weakness to its fate and carry the fight to a new sector. Only now has it become clear that this was precisely Emanuel Lasker’s standard approach to the game, and that one of his major advantages over his rivals lay in the fact that none of them understood it.
On the other hand, this approach was hardly Lasker’s only distinguishing characteristic. He was the game’s great psychologist, who knew better than anyone how to make the pendulum of battle swing left, then right, never overstepping the bounds of safety himself, while imperceptibly goading his opponent over the edge. He would deliberately play second-rate moves, practically inviting his orthodox opponent to punish him. Nowadays, even this style has been analyzed and superseded. Today’s players are ready at times to give their opponents what would appear to be a positional advantage from the very first moves.
Clear examples of this are the positions that arise in the King’s Indian after ...exd4, as well as the group of positions after 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6 4.Nc3 exd5 5.cxd5. The Boleslavsky Variation of the Sicilian, with its gaping hole at d5 and the hopelessly backward pawn on d6, might seem unbelievably daring, but nonetheless it withstands every assault. In this book, we will find a number of such examples.
The reader will also find here descriptions of the technical ways and means employed by the contemporary master in the middlegame. The concept of technique is much broader now than it was a few decades ago, and what was once a rare occurrence, a lucky find, is now the tool of the masses.
Without technique, one cannot attain mastery of any form; it is no less impossible in chess.
However, the importance of technique in chess should not be exaggerated, either. The end phase of the game, frequently described as “a matter of technique”, is certainly not always that clear and simple. Thirty years ago, Capablanca was considered the greatest technical player in the world; today it is Smyslov. After analysis of the so-called technical games of Capablanca and Smyslov, I concluded that they are based on the combinative element and on far-seeing and accurate analysis, and that as a consequence their technique is of an unusually high order. The same could be said, to a greater or lesser degree, of the endgames played by many grandmasters. I will mention only two here from this tournament: Euwe’s against Stahlberg, and Gligoric’s against Euwe.
Another characteristic quality of the contemporary creative output, which the reader will note more than once in the games of this tournament, is a readiness to react instantly to any change in the opponent’s plans, and to make radical alterations in one’s own plan, if given sufficient justification.
One of the most prominent — and promising — tendencies which came forward in the course of this tournament was a penchant for wide-open piece play almost from the first moves. Apparently Morphy’s style retains an irresistible fascination for chessplayers in every age, and a return to this style, refined perhaps to a higher level, is the dream of all players, grandmasters included. To me, it appears that we are closer to this ideal now than we have been at any time in the past century.
This new tendency, whose representatives have blazed a trail through the USSR Championships, the 1955 and 1958 Interzonal tournaments, and the 1959 Candidates’ tournament, is characterized by an effort to take the game out of its logical channels at any cost, redirecting it into the combinative — or, more accurately, the calculative. The material side of the question — a pawn more or an exchange less — has no special significance. There is absolutely no need to demonstrate the combination’s correctness in every variation. More likely the reverse may be true: in the majority of cases, it turns out that the defending side could have held out by finding a series of saving moves. But here the New Wave grandmaster trusts in himself and in his phenomenal ability to calculate a vast number of long and complicated variations.
Sometimes this can give the game a very strange turn indeed. As one positional master said, “I fought him (a master of the calculative style) for thirty-two moves, and never guessed his reply, except once, when he had to take my queen.”
The foremost advocates of this dynamic style today are undoubtedly Mikhail Tal and Boris Spassky. Of course, complicating and turning the game into a war of calculation are not the only weapons in the arsenal of these unusually talented and well-rounded players. They are past masters of the techniques of positional play, conduct brilliant endgames, know the openings well, and surpass other masters precisely in their skill at giving the game a dynamic twist, making it the sort of game which is absolutely impossible to evaluate by landmarks; willy-nilly, one must then play “move by move”, or perhaps even “variation by variation”.
The time came for one of them to try his mettle, and the viability of his personal style, in single combat against the most powerful player of the past two decades: Mikhail Moiseevich Botvinnik. The results of that encounter and of the tournaments that led to it show, first of all, that in Mikhail Nekhemevich Tal we have the representative of a definite new direction; and second, that the existence of this direction does not by any stretch of the imagination signify an end to the kind of chess struggle that is based not only on the computation of variations, but on logic and principle as well.
The author of this book, in the course of his twenty-year life in chess, has played quite a few sharp, tense games, where he had to balance for a while on a sword edge; but I would certainly be the last to conclude that chess consists solely of calculating variations. And I would hope that, rather than see the further course of chess history bear out such a conclusion, the new style of play will instead become but one of many elements in the arsenal of creative techniques that are comprised in the art of chess.
ROUND ONE
1. Szabo—Geller
(Catalan Opening)
I have long suspected, whenever the books I have read began discussing darksquare weaknesses or an attack on the dark squares, that the subject under discussion was not only beyond my understanding, but beyond the author’s as well. “Certainly,”, I would say to myself, “it must be true that the enemy dark squares will be weak if his pawns stand on light squares and he loses his dark-square bishop. But if he then removes all of his pieces from the dark squares, what will be left for me to attack?”
Such was my line of reasoning, until the day I realized that a weakness of the dark squares is also a weakness of the pieces and pawns on the light squares. Light-square weaknesses are also possible, resulting in a weakening of the enemy pieces and pawns on the dark squares — as occurred, for example, in the Geller - Najdorf game in Round 13. The point of an attack on the dark squares is that, by placing my pawns and pieces on the dark, I attack my opponent’s pieces and pawns on the light.
The Szabo - Geller game provides a clear example of the method of exploiting a darksquare weakness; and the combination which was possible after Black’s 24th fairly begs to be included in a textbook, taking place as it does entirely on light squares.
1.c4 Nf6
2.g3 e6
3.Bg2 d5
4.d4 dxc4
5.Qa4+ Nbd7
6.Nf3 a6
7.Qxc4 b5
8.Qc6 ...
Having hatched a plan to weaken the enemy dark squares, Szabo undertakes a delicate maneuver aimed at bringing about the exchange of the darksquare bishops, which will further strengthen his grip on the dark squares.
8...Rb8
9.Bf4 Nd5
10.Bg5 Be7
11.Bxe7 Qxe7
12.0-0 Bb7
13.Qc2 c5
14.dxc5 Nxc5
15.Rc1 Rc8
16.Nc3 Nf6
A small but serious inaccuracy: Black removes this piece from the main theater of operations. Additionally, the combination 17.Nxb5 axb5 18.b4 now becomes possible, due to the insufficiently protected rook at c8. Szabo, however, continues with his plan, fixing the pawns at a6 and b5 on their light squares. 16...Nb6 would have been much better for Black: increasing his control of c4 would have made it more difficult for White to decide, on b2-b4.
17.b4 Na4
18.Qb3 Nxc3
19.Rxc3 Rxc3
20.Qxc3 0-0
21.Rc1 Rd8
Geller cannot take the c-file away from his opponent, for if 21...Rc8, White would simply take the rook: 22.Qxc8+ Bxc8 23.Rxc8+ Ne8 24.Ne5!, and there is no stopping 25.Bc6.
22.a3 Nd5
Seeing that White’s positional squeeze could become very dangerous, should he succeed in occupying the seventh rank or in establishing his knight on c5, Geller decides to complicate (his move also stops both threats).
23.Qd4 f6
24.Ne1 e5
25.Qc5 ...
A consistent, though rather uninspired, continuation. 25.Qa7! would certainly have been much prettier, retaining his hold on the dark squares while attacking the enemy pieces and pawns on the light squares. Black would be unable to smoke the queen out, since 25...Ra8 would obviously fail against 26.Bxd5+; while after 25...Kf8 26.Nd3 Ra8 27.Qc5, the exchange of queens would bring the white knight to c5. And finally, 25...Rd7 brings on an elegant little combination: 26.Qxb7! If Black takes the queen (26...Rxb7), then 27.Bxd5+, followed by 28.Rc8+ leads to the complete extermination of Black’s pieces — curiously enough, all of them perish on light squares.
Black may have intended to answer 25.Qa7 with 25...e4, and if 26.Bxe4, not 26...Nf4? (which would be nicely refuted by 27.Bf3), but simply 26...Qxe4 27.Qxb7 Qxe2, with an unclear game. On 25...e4, however, White’s bishop would leave the blocked diagonal for an equally successful career on its neighbor (with 26.Bh3).
25...Qxc5
26.bxc5
White would have maintained a clear advantage with 26.Rxc5, but Szabo probably thought that his pin on the knight, combined with his threat to advance the c-pawn would assure him victory. However, Black finds the defensive maneuver ...Rd8-d7-e7.
26...Bc6
27.Rd1 Rd7
28.Bh3 Re7
29.Nc2 a5
30.Bg2 Rd7
31.Bh3 Re7
32.Kf1 ...
Szabo declines the repetition, although he no longer has the better position. This is a psychological error common to chessplayers of all ranks from beginner to grandmaster: to lose one’s objectivity is almost invariably to lose the game as well.
32...Kf7
33.Ke1
This was White’s last chance to force the draw with Bh3-g2-h3.
33...Rc7
34.Rd3 Bb7
And now White will lose his c-pawn.
35.Ne3 Rxc5
36.Nf5 Bc6
37.Nd6+ Kf8
38.Bg2 g6
39.Kd2 Ke7

42.Nf2 Ra4
43.Nd1 e4
44.fxe4 fxe4
45.Rb3 Rd4+
46.Kc1 b4
Black’s plan is simple: to create a passed pawn and queen it. White can offer no real resistance to this.
47.Ne3 Nc3

WHITE RESIGNED
2. Najdorf—Reshevsky
(Nimzoindian Defense)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6
3.Nc3 Bb4
4.e3 ...
Aron Nimzovich, who invented this defense, could hardly have thought that thirty years later the masters of chess still would not have solved the basic problem: whether putting the question to Black’s bishop with an immediate 4.a3 is good or bad. Naturally, if we knew it to be good, that would render all other tries pointless, to say the least.
4...c5
5.Bd3 0-0
6.Nf3 d5
Nimzovich never used to advance his c-pawn to c5 without need; he hoped that, after he gave White doubled pawns by means of the exchange at c3, sooner or later he could induce White to play d4-d5, after which he could establish his knight at c5. A lot of water has gone under the bridge since, and the modern master puts no great stock in that far-off prospect of capitalizing on the doubled c-pawns. Instead, the immediate counterattack on the center with every means available has become one of the standard ideas for Black in the Nimzo-Indian.
7.0-0 Nc6
8.a3 Bxc3
9.bxc3 dxc4
10.Bxc4 Qc7
Today, this position has been studied as thoroughly as were the Muzio and Evans Gambits a century ago. What are the basic features of this position, and how does the evaluation of those features give rise to the further plans for both sides?
The placement of White’s pieces radiates a great deal of potential energy, which ought to be converted into kinetic — White must set his center pawns in motion, activating both his rooks and his deeply-buried darksquare bishop. The most logical plan would seem to be the advance of the e-pawn, first to e4, and then to e5, to drive Black’s knight from f6 and lay the groundwork for a kingside attack.
Black in turn must either prevent the e-pawn’s advance or counterattack the white pawn center, which will lose some of its solidity the moment the pawn advances from e3 to e4.
In this game, Reshevsky combines both of Black’s ideas to achieve a favorable disposition of his forces, while Najdorf does not put nearly enough vigor into the execution of his plan.
11.a4 ...
Of all the possible continuations that have been used here, this one may well be the least logical: it resolves only one minor problem, the development of the queen’s bishop— and to a poor square, at that. The pawn at c5 will find defenders easily enough, and the bishop will find itself out of the action. That outflung pawn at a4 will not be a jewel in White’s position either.
11...b6
12.Ba3 Bb7
13.Be2 Rfd8
14.Qc2 Na5
15.dxc5 bxc5
16.c4 Be4
17.Qc3 Rab8
Another weak point in White’s position: Black now controls b3. White cannot play 18.Rb1, and 18.Nd2 is not attractive either.
18.Rfd1 Rxd1+
19.Rxd1 Bc6!
Initiating a straightforward siege of the a-pawn.
20.Qc2 h6
21.h3 Nb3
Black hasn’t the time to bring the knight to b6: if 21...Nd7, then 22.Bb2 Nb6 23.Qc3, forking g7 and a5.
22.Bb2 Nd7
23.Qc3 f6
Strategically, Black already has a won game: the a-pawn is falling, while White has yet to find useful employment for his bishops. In this difficult situation, Najdorf employs the resiliency of his position to work up one last tactical try.
24.Nh2 ...
As time-pressure approaches, the less strategy and the more tactics.
24...Nb6
How to meet the threat of 25...Nxa4 is a question White was never called upon to answer, because Reshevsky, having four minutes left to make his last 16 moves, offered a draw. Evidently he was unable to calculate fully the consequences of White’s combination 25.Ng4 Nxa4 26.Nxf6+ gxf6 27.Qxf6. Right after the game, and later in his published commentaries as well, Najdorf showed that he had a guaranteed draw: for example, 27...Nxb2 28.Bg4, and there is no escaping the perpetual after 29.Bxe6+ and 30.Bf5+, etc. One pretty variation is 28...Qg7 29.Bxe6+ Kh7 30.Bf5+ Kh8 31.Rd8+ Rxd8 32.Qxd8+ Qg8 33.Qf6+.
If Black had not taken the pawn at move 25, playing 25...e5 instead, then 26.Qc2 and 27.Qg6 also leads inevitably to a perpetual check.
White would have had a harder time if, instead of 24...Nb6, Black had simply played 24...Bxa4, leaving the knight to defend the king side. Now 25.Ng4 would not have nearly the same effect, in view of 25...e5 26.Qc2 Nf8. Another possibility after 24...Nb6 25.Ng4 would be 25...Nd4; for example: 26.exd4 Nxa4, etc. The aim of 25...Nd4 is to close off the c3-f6 diagonal, thereby cancelling out white’s Nxf6+ gxf6; Qxf6. Since such variations are impossible to calculate accurately in time-pressure, Reshevsky preferred the
DRAW
3. Petrosian—Keres
(English Opening)
1.c4 c5
2.Nf3 Nf6
3.d4 cxd4
4.Nxd4 e6
5.g3 d5
6.Bg2 e5
In contrast to his opponent’s somewhat slothful play, Keres is handling the opening energetically: taking advantage of a tactical nuance (7.Nf3 d4 8.Nxe5 Qa5+), he obtains a brace of powerful center pawns, just waiting for the chance to push onward.
7.Nc2 d4
8.0-0 Nc6
9.Nd2 Bg4
10.Nf3 a5
It was time to start thinking about castling and developing the rooks to support the further advance of the pawns. One attractive line, involving long castling – 10...Bxf3 11.Bxf3 e4 12.Bg2 h6 13.b3 Qd7 14.Bb2 0-0-0–fails to come off, because on the 11th move White recaptures, not with the bishop, but with the pawn, which he then advances to f4, breaking up the enemy center pawns. After the text move, Black no longer has to worry about an eventual b2-b4.
11.Bg5 Bc5
Black sets up the threat of 12...e4, but grants White the opportunity to stop this pawn cold. After 11...Be7!, White would not have had this blockading opportunity. In order to meet the threatened advance of the e-pawn, White would have been practically forced to make the exchange on f6.
12.e4 h6
13.Bxf6 Qxf6
14.Nce1 Qe6
The most important point in this position is unquestionably d4: it marks the intersection of the lines of force from the black bishop to the white king and from the black rook to the white queen; also, if the black knight could get to d4, it would take away four squares from the white queen and strengthen the pin on the knight at f3. White’s next — and quite obvious — move will reduce the value of this communications nexus to a minimum, if not to zero. The blockaded d-pawn will frustrate both the bishop on c5 and the rook on a8 with its aspirations to d8. The nexus could have been cleared for the price of a pawn: 14...d3 would have given Black a very promising game.
15.Nd3 Be7
16.h3 Bxf3
Black could not capture the h-pawn (16...Bxh3), since 17.Bxh3 Qxh3 18.Ndxe5 Nxe5 19.Nxe5 would have deprived him of either the castling privilege or his d-pawn; and retreating to h5 (16...Bh5) would have permitted 17.Nxd4!
17.Qxf3 Qxc4
18.Rfc1 Qe6
19.Qf5 ...
A pretty final stroke, based on combinative motifs, to the defensive system White has devised. If Black exchanges queens and continues with ...f7-f6, he will lose: 19...Qxf5 20.exf5 f6 21.Rxc6! bxc6 22.Bxc6+ Kf7 23.Bd5+!, followed by the capture of the rook at a8. If, after exchanging queens, Black defends the e-pawn with his bishop instead, then White has a positional advantage. And if 19...Qd6, then 20.f4 g6 21.fxe5, or 20.Rc5 are strong.
19...Bd6 20.Qxe6+ fxe6 21.a3 Kd7 22.Bf1 a4 23.Ne1 Ra5 24.Rc2 Rc8 25.Rac1 Na7 26.Rxc8 Nxc8 27.Bc4 Be7
The position is now a clear draw: White’s knight returns to d3 presently, leaving Black no place to penetrate. Keres plays it out to the 41st move and adjourns, hoping to find some hidden resource at his leisure.
28.Nd3 Nd6 29.f3 Nxc4 30.Rxc4 Bd6 31.Kf2 Ra6 32.Ke2 g5 33.Kd1 Ra8 34.Ke2 h5 35.Rc1 Rh8 36.Rh1 h4 37.g4 b5 38.Rc1 Rb8 39.Kd1 Rb6 40.Rc2 Rb8 41.Rc1 Rc8
The game was agreed a
DRAW
without further play.
4. Averbakh—Smyslov
(Ruy Lopez)
1.e4 e5

6.Re1 b5
7.Bb3 d6
8.c3 0-0
9.h3 Na5
10.Bc2 c5
11.d4 Qc7
Chigorin’s System in the Ruy Lopez is a frequent guest in international competition, but it appeared in Zurich only six times. White marshals his forces for a kingside attack which generally doesn’t have much bite to it, since today’s grandmasters have learned quite well how to set up a defensible position. Not surprisingly, therefore, most of the games played with this variation have lately been winding up drawn.
12.Nbd2 Bd7
13.Nf1 Rfe8
14.Ne3 Bf8
15.Bd2 g6
16.Rc1 ...
I find it hard to tie White’s last two moves in with his strategic plan: the bishop on d2 and the rook on c1 are not one whit better placed than they were at their original positions. After this loss of two tempi, White’s diversion on the kingside can have no serious future. Averbakh decides to generate piece play on this wing without taking on additional responsibilities with the advance of the g-pawn.
16...Nc6
17.dxc5 dxc5
18.Nh2 Rad8
19.Qf3 Bg7
20.Red1 Be6
21.Bb1 Qe7
This being the first round, both players wage rather bloodless battle: neither has yet pushed a man past the boundary of his own territory. Both sides are concealing, as much as possible, the area in which they intend to take action.
22.Nhg4 Nxg4
23.Nxg4 ...
In the event of 23.hxg4, Black had prepared the reply 23...Qh4.
23...Na5
24.b3 Nc6
25.Be3 Rxd1+
26.Qxd1 Rd8
27.Qf3 Rd7
28.Rd1 b4
As a result of White’s slow play, Black has obtained a slight advantage. Now he wishes to secure d4 for his knight, but he might well have considered a plan involving ...c5-c4, which could be prepared here with 28...a5.
29.Rxd7 ...
29...Bxd7
30.Nh6+ ...
Smyslov wasn’t worried about the check at h6, intending simply to move his king to f8 (30...Kf8); but at the last moment he noticed the textbook stroke 31.Bxc5!, and the queen is lost. Now he must give up his darksquare bishop instead, which might have proved decisive under other circumstances.
30...Bxh6
31.Bxh6 bxc3
32.Qxc3 Nd4
DRAW
Black’s centralized knight fully compensates for White’s powerful bishop at h6.
5. Taimanov—Bronstein
(Benoni Defense)
It’s a difficult thing to maintain objectivity when commenting on one’s own games. Variations running in the commentator’s favor are always interesting, so details flow quick and plentiful from the pen; variations which favor one’s opponent, however, are often unclear as can be. For one’s own mistakes, one seeks (and generally finds) justification; while the opponent’s errors seem so natural as to need no explanation whatever. So even before beginning to comment on my game from Round One, I feel compelled to note that Black did not have a decisive advantage until very late in the game, almost the very end. Psychologically, White’s loss can be traced to the fact that he missed the turning point of the game, at which it was necessary for him to begin giving serious thought to the problem of how to get a draw. As regards the purely chessic reasons for his loss, these I shall try to illuminate in my notes.
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 c5
3.d5 g6
4.Nc3 d6
5.e4 b5
What does Black achieve by sacrificing a pawn? First, he undermines the spearhead of the white pawn chain, the pawn on d5; in addition, after the unavoidable ...a7-a6 and b5xa6, he obtains the good diagonal a6-f1 for his bishop, which would have far fewer prospects along the c8-h3 diagonal. The two open files Black obtains on the queen-side, allowing him active play against White’s a- and b-pawns, also speak in favor of the sacrifice. Nor ought we to forget Black’s bishop at g7: since Black intends to leave his e-pawn at e7 in this system, the bishop’s sphere of activity is automatically increased. And finally, there is the interesting strategic idea (encountered also in other variations of the King’s Indian) of developing the queen’s rook without moving it from its original square.
Of course, the sacrifice has its deficiencies as well, chief among these being the pawn deficit. Should White gradually succeed in overcoming all his difficulties, and reach an endgame, he will have excellent winning chances. It is for this last reason that this variation was not seen in any more games from this tournament. I used it here, partly because I did not want to begin this tournament with the sort of protracted defense Black is usually forced to put up with in one of the “normal” lines.
6.cxb5 Bg7
7.Nf3 0-0
8.Be2 a6
Up to this point, Black might still have hoped to regain his pawn, but now it becomes a real sacrifice.
9.bxa6 Bxa6
10.0-0 ...
Once I had precisely the same position to play, but as White, vs. Lundin at Stockholm, 1948. I traded bishops, whereupon Black recaptured at a6 with his knight, which he then brought via c7 and b5 to d4. This seemed overly protracted to me, so in the present game I recaptured at a6 with my rook, sending the queen’s knight via d7 and b6 to a4, trading off the white queen’s knight and weakening the defense of the pawns at a2 and b2.
10...Qc7
11.Re1 Nbd7
12.Bxa6 Rxa6
13.Qe2 ...
Taimanov has decided on e4-e5, cracking the foundation of the Black position; but this proves tactically unrealizable. White would have had more prospects with 11.Bf4 and 13.Qd2, instead of his 11.Re1 and 13.Qe2: afterwards, he could post his rooks to c1 and b1, with the idea of gradually clearing all of his pieces and pawns off the enemy bishop’s long diagonal. And after that, White would prepare the advance b2-b4, beginning the active realization of his extra pawn. This is how I played against Lundin, and I still consider it to be the correct plan.
13...Rfa8
14.h3 ...
Taimanov’s intended 14.e5 no longer appeals to him in view of 14...dxe5 15.Nxe5 Nxe5 16.Qxe5 Qxe5 17.Rxe5 Kf8.
14...Nb6
15.Bg5 Ne8
16.Bd2 ...
Once again, 16.e5 dxe5 17.Nxe5 f6 does not work, but this does not mean he should have brought the bishop back. 16.a3 was better, allowing Black to recover his pawn at the cost of his dark-square bishop: 16...Bxc3 17.bxc3 Rxa3 18.Rac1. Black would stand actively on the queenside, but with some dangerous darksquare weaknesses about his king.
16...Na4
17.Nxa4 Rxa4
18.Bc3 Bxc3
I did not want to capture the a-pawn, since White would then achieve his goal: 18...Rxa2? 19.Rxa2 Rxa2 20.e5, and Black has no queenside targets, while White gets some dangerous threats in the center.
19.c3 Qa5
20.Qd3 Qa6
Black’s endgame advantage is founded on the fact that his base pawn at e7 is close to home and therefore easy to defend, while the white pawns at c3 and e4 afford excellent targets to Black’s rooks. If the e-pawn advances, then the pawn on d5 becomes weak. The following lines give an approximate idea of what all this means in practical terms: 21.Qxa6 R8xa6 22.Re2 Nf6; or 22.e5 Nc7; or 22.Rab1 Rxa2 23.Rb8 Ra8 24.Reb1 Ra1. Taimanov was correct in avoiding this exchange of queens - but he should also have avoided it later on.
21.Qd2 Rxa2

Black now has a weak pawn at c5, and White could, for example, exchange knights and give up his two queenside pawns for Black’s one, and the draw would be assured, since the rook endgame with four pawns against three on the same side is generally not winnable. All this, however, is easier said than done.
26.Nb3 ...
Taimanov is a born optimist. Having weathered his troubles reasonably enough, he immediately begins to ask himself why he cannot simply win the black pawn. 26.Kf1 would have been a more suitable move for the endgame, and would have left White far fewer, if any, losing chances.

The system Black has selected is not without its drawbacks, positionally speaking, but he does possess several trumps: the open e-file, good diagonals for both his bishops, and three pawns against two on the queenside. For his part, white can usually establish a knight at c4, putting the squeeze on the d-pawn, the keystone of Black’s entire fortress. In this game, Euwe decides he would rather play on the queen-side, creating weaknesses there for occupation by his pieces. Later, the game gets interesting, thanks to bold play — bold to the point of sacrifices — by both sides.
10.a4 Nbd7
11.Nd2 ...
A typical maneuver in this position: White brings the knight to c4, and then plays a4-a5 to neutralize Black’s queenside majority by blockade; should Black then play ...b7-b5, white’s knight gains access to a5 and c6.

18...Nf6
Black had a strong move at his disposal, namely 18...Rab8, underscoring the white queen’s insecure position: for example, 19.Nxb5 axb5 20.Nc6 Rb7, and White cannot play 21.Qxb5 in view of 21...Nxd5. After 18...Rab8, the threat of 19...c4 would carry more weight also.

Fifteen years ago, the King’s Indian Defense was played in Soviet tournaments only by those wishing to avoid the passive, thoroughly analyzed variations of the Queen’s Gambit Declined; outside our borders, it was hardly played at all. As recently as the 1948 World’s Championship, the King’s Indian figured in only two games out of fifty. Here in Zurich, one out of three games opened with 1.d2-d4 turned into a King’s Indian, and foreign players used it just as often as ours did.
The diagrammed position is a familiar one to theory; the text move is one of the latest discoveries. Wishing to develop his bishop to e3, White also over-protects his e-pawn!
The knight at d4 is temporarily undefended, of course, and Black could win a center pawn by 12...Nfxe4 13.Nxe4 Bxd4; but then it would be White’s turn to move, and he would seize the key square f6 with 14.Bg5 Qd7 15.Nf6+ Bxf6 16.Bxf6, removing Black’s “Indian” bishop, without which all Indian configurations become pointless. The extra pawn would be no consolation: occasional attempts to prove otherwise have nearly all wound up disastrously for Black, so no one snaps at the e-pawn anymore.
12...a4
13.Be3 c6
14.Rad1 Nfd7
Characteristically, the King’s Indian Defense features a tense battle waged on all fronts simultaneously. The system used here secures White considerable territory, not only in the center, but on the kingside as well.
I do not wish to leave the reader the false impression that White’s further task, which is to transform his sizable spatial plus into a material advantage, will be an easy one. The secret of the King’s Indian’s hardihood is that, while conceding space, Black builds a few small but weighty details into his configuration. Foremost among these are his long-range bishops at g7 and c8, his firmly entrenched knight at c5 and the rook at e8, which maintain constant watch on the e-pawn. Nor ought we to forget his pawns. The “weak” pawn on d6 is just waiting for the chance to push to d5, so White must continually keep an eye on that. The pawn at a4 also has an important role: the threat to advance it to a3 can upset his opponent’s plans for that sector at any time, so White must take extra precautions regarding the defense of c3 and c4. If 12.Qc2 was White’s latest theoretical discovery, then the same might justifiably be said of Black’s 14...Nfd7. 14...Qa5 was the old move, but after 15.Bf4, either the bishop at g7 or the rook at e8 had to move to an inferior position, whereas now the pawn can be covered with 15...Ne5.
15.f4 Qa5
16.Bf2 Nb6
17.Bf1 Bd7
18.a3 ...
Stahlberg decides to rid his position once and for all of the threat of a black pawn advance to a3. This move deprives the square b3 of pawn protection, but it also strengthens the position of the pawn at b2 and generally of the whole constellation a3-b2-c3.
The next stage of the game — roughly to move 30 — consists of skillful maneuvers from both sides, inducing weaknesses, White’s preparation for e4-e5 and Black’s for ...d7-d5 or ...f7-f5, and mutual prevention of these breaks.
18...Rad8
19.Kh2 Bc8
20.Na2 Nbd7
21.Bg2 Nf6
22.Nc3 Rd7
23.Nf3 Rde7
The next two moves are somewhat unusual, both for White and for Black: Black concentrates maximum firepower against the pawn at e4, an assault which White tries to divert by threatening to take on d6. It is entirely characteristic that, in order to carry out this idea, White can find no better retreat square for his centralized knight at d4, the pride of his position, than back to its original square g1, since all other retreat squares would interfere, in one way or another, with the coordination between his pieces.
This seems an appropriate time to impart to the reader the secret of the d6-pawn in the King’s Indian Defense. This pawn, although backward on an open file, proves nevertheless a tough little nut to crack, because it is so hard to reach. It might seem that nothing could be simpler than dropping the knight back from d4, but the problem is that White needs his knight precisely on d4, where it observes the squares b5, c6, e6 and f5, and neutralizes the power of the bishop at g7. Only after White has taken precautions against all of Black’s possible attacks (...a4-a3, ...Bc8-e6, ...f7-f5) can his knight allow itself to leave the center; but meanwhile Black has time to regroup.
So the weakness of the d6-pawn turns out to be largely fictive. Modern methods of opening play allow for many such fictive weak pawns, but it was precisely this “permanent” weakness at d6 which so long condemned the King’s Indian to the list of dubious openings.
24.Ng1 ...
The knight will return, five moves later, to help the pawn on e4 cross the Rubicon. The pawn could have been pushed at once, but that would have given up control of the f5 square; Black’s bishop could go there, and after 24.e5 Bf5, White would have had to sacrifice his queen by taking the knight at f6 with his pawn — but that would win for White. The simple 24...dxe5, on the other hand, would give Black excellent play.
White could have taken the a-pawn here, but at too great a price: White needs his darksquare bishop as much as Black does.
Boleslavsky’s 24th move is an invitation to White’s rook to capture that long-disputed point at last; after 25...Nb6, however, Black’s knight enters c4. Stahlberg’s decision is most probably the correct one: before proceeding with the siege of the d-pawn, he exchanges off the “Indian” bishops.
24...Nfd7
25.Bd4 Nb6
26.Bxg7 Kxg7
27.Rxd6 Nxc4
28.Rdd1 Be6
The position appears basically unchanged, but an important event has taken place: the disappearance of the darksquare bishops, and of the pawns at c4 and d6. With the bishops’ disappearance, both sides must now make some adjustments in their basic strategies. Black, for example, must give top priority to securing his position on the long diagonal, and against the incursion of a white pawn to f6 and queen to h6. Considering the seriousness of this threat, Boleslavsky’s last move was a very good one: the bishop is ready for action on the a2-g8 diagonal, and the f-pawn, by going to f6, covers the king against any attacks from the main road; the bishop replaces the pawn at f7. White, for his part, must punch a hole in this new defensive line at any cost, or else the initiative will pass to his opponent, and all the weaknesses in White’s position, which were of only passing interest so long as he was on the offensive (b3, the lack of pawn control of d3, c3 and f3, and the passive bishop at g2), might become the basis for combinations.
29.Qf2 f6
30.Nf3 Bf7
31.e5 ...
Stahlberg is a consummate tactician, and a master of the king-side attack, and this sacrifice is in his style. White cannot be left master of e5, so the pawn must be taken; but this opens the f-file, and Black’s king comes under fire.
31...fxe5
32.Nxe5 Nxe5
33.Rxe5 Rxe5
34.fxe5 Re5
35.Rf1 Rf5
In the heat of battle, Boleslavsky disregards his fierce time-pressure and declines the draw he could probably have secured by means of the accurate retreat 35...Qc7, defending against both threats, 36.Qxf7 and 36.Qf6+. Black’s dream of capitalizing on his extra pawn is impractical, considering his exposed king. Even if Black should successfully run the gauntlet, warding off all assaults, White could still, in all probability, find a perpetual check.
36.Qd4+ ...
White’s task is now partially complete: the queen has attained the long diagonal.
36...Kg8
37.Rxf5 gxf5
38.Qe5 ...
Judging from his next two moves, it seems quite likely that Black simply overlooked this modest little move, which shakes his position to its foundations.
38...Qb6!
The pin on the knight must be liquidated at once. The threat was not so much 38...-- 39.Qxf5 as 39.g4, and if 39...fxg4 40.Ne4. With this timely retreat of his queen to b6, Black avoids the worst. Attempting to save his f-pawn by 38...Bg6 might have had tragic consequences, since besides 39.g4, White could also have exploited the new pin motif to drive the black king into a mating net almost by force: 39.Bf1 Qb6 40.Bc4+ Kf8 41.Qf6+ Ke8 42.Nd5 - such variations are certainly not for time-pressure. Now White restores the material balance, and Black’s king is in as much danger as before.
39.Qxf5 Bg6
40.Qe5 Nd3
Black uses his last move before the time control to remind White that there are targets in his own camp too. Black’s queen is ready to take the b-pawn, or, circumstances permitting, to enter at f2 with the threat of ...Ne1.
41.Qe6+ ...
41...Kg7?
This was the move Black wrote on his scoresheet, then sealed in the envelope which was handed to the chief arbiter of the tournament. Stahlberg, of course, without any knowledge of that sealed move, had to analyze both of Black’s possible replies, 41...Kg7 and ...Bf7.
42.Qe7+ ...
When he adjourned, Boleslavsky considered the possibility 42.Nd5, but felt that after 42...Qxb2 White would have, at most, a perpetual check. This powerful move, however, changes matters completely. Black cannot retreat to g8 (42...Kg8), since 43.Nd5 would follow; so the bishop has to interpose, but then the knight can enter d6 via e4. So 41...Bf7 was a better move than 41...Kg7: White could give perpetual check or win the a-pawn with 42.Qg4+, but this would be fully compensated by the black queen’s entry into f2. The most likely outcome would then be a draw. Well, the game was a draw here, too, but only after some interesting new adventures.
42...Bf7
43.Ne4 Qxb2
44.Nd6 Qf2
45.Ne8+ ...
Certainly the obvious, “what-else” moves are not always best.
45...Kg8
46.Nf6+ Kg7
47.Nh5+ Kg6
48.g4 Nc5
DRAW
— on Stahlberg’s offer. The attempt to end the game with a queen-sacrifice mating combination: 49.h4 h6? 50.Qxc5!! Qxc5 51.Be4+, is refuted by 49...Ne6.
48.h4 would not have won either: Black replies 48...h6, and after 49.Qe4+ Kxh5 50.Kh3, with the apparently unstoppable threat of mate by 51.g4, Black liquidates the threat with the surprising counterstroke 50...Nf4+.
However, 45.h4, instead of 45.Ne8+, would have led to victory.

(Queen’s Gambit)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6
3.Nf3 d5
4.Nc3 Be7
5.cxd5 exd5
White usually enters the Exchange Variation of the Orthodox Queen’s Gambit with the intention of playing a minority attack, in which he stations his rooks on the b- and c-files, and then advances his b-pawn and trades it off onc6 to create a backward black pawn. A number of master games have demonstrated that this is too direct a plan to pose any great danger to Black, who may, in his turn, expand upon his control of the e-file to carry an active piece game to the kingside, establishing approximate equality.
For this game, Kotov is not after a draw: he has other reasons altogether for trading off the center pawns. In the tradition of the old masters, he intends castling long, followed by a kingside pawn storm — an idea he conceals quite well for the next 5-7 moves.
6.Bf4 c6
7.Qc2 g6
8.e3 Bf5
9.Bd3 Bxd3
10.Qxd3 Nbd7
11.h3 Nf8
Black’s last five moves are all part of one plan. Stahlberg is perhaps the only grandmaster of our day who retains the Orthodox Defense as part of his repertoire, and he plays it like a virtuoso. This system, with 7...g6 and the knight transfer to e6 prior to castling, is his invention. Neither Kotov, in the present game, nor the author, in the tournament’s second half, nor even the World Champion, Botvinnik himself, in the Budapest tournament of 1952, could find any weak spot in the Swedish grandmaster’s favorite defense.
12.g4 ...
Kotov has kept his battle plans encoded long enough: now at last his true intentions are revealed.
12...Ne6
13.Bg3 ...
This move is more than a little inconsequent. It would be good, if White were carrying out the queenside minority attack; but here, after the pawn has been pushed to g4, the more provocative 13.Be5 is better.

Both sides prefer the new situation, each for his own reasons: White, because he has a new open file, and the pawn is closer to the center; and Black, because he need no longer fear the pawn storm, and he now controls the key square e4.
18...Ne4

The game has gone into an ending which favors White a bit, and requires accurate play from Black. White would have done better to play 21.Rb1, answering 21...Rd7 with 22.Rb2; then, after the f-file opened, he could obtain counterpressure on the b-pawn, saving his a2-a4 until after Black’s ...b7-b6.

However, he would have some practical chances of a draw in the following variation: 36.axb6 axb6 37.Ra1 h3 38.Rh1 Rh7 39.Rh2; pawns are equal for the moment, and White’s rook is unapproachable; to play for the win, therefore, Black’s king must go for the g-pawn, which time White could use to attack the b- and c-pawns: 39...Kf5 40.Kb4 Kxg5 41.c5, and if 41...bxc5+, White gets his draw; but on 41...b5, he is one tempo short: 42.d5 cxd5 43.Kxb5 Kh4 44.c6 — with the white king on b6, this would be a draw. But he should still have tried it, especially since the whole variation occurs just before the time control.

9. Geller—Euwe
(Nimzoindian Defense)
One of the tournament’s best games, and the recipient of a brilliancy prize. White initiated a powerful attack on the king by sacrificing his c4-pawn. This attack gave Geller every hope of success, provided Black held to the traditional sort of queen-side counterattack. Euwe, however, carried out two remarkable ideas: 1) utilizing his queen-side lines of communication for an attack on the king’s wing, and 2) decoying the enemy’s forces deep into his own rear area, with the aim of cutting them off from the defense of their king.
It’s a most diverting spectacle to watch White’s pieces in their frontal assault on the king, burrowing further and further, while Black is transferring his forces by roundabout routes.

A small but significant opening subtlety: Black substituted ...b6 and ...Bb7 for the more usual ...Nc6 and ...0-0; and White, who failed to notice in time to react correctly with 7.Ne2, must now spend an extra tempo preparing e3-e4. Such details should never be underestimated, but neither should they be overvalued. Occasionally it is said that White’s advantage consists of his right to the first move: should he lose a tempo, then, the advantage must necessarily pass to Black. Practically speaking, however, the advantage of playing White boils down to greater freedom in selecting a plan to suit one’s tastes; once the game has settled into its ordained track, the loss of a single tempo is not always so serious.
8...Nc6
9.Ne2 0-0
10.0-0 Na5
11.e4 Ne8
Black retreats his knight to forestall the pin with 12.Bg5, and to be able to answer f3-f4 with ...f7-f5, blockading the king’s wing. White therefore secures f5 before advancing his f-pawn. It would be senseless to defend the pawn at c4 now: that pawn was doomed by White’s fifth move.
12.Ng3 cxd4
13.cxd4 Rc8
14.f4 Nxc4
15.f5 f6
16.Rf4 ...
White’s attack has become rather threatening. Black’s previous move was necessary to forestall White’s intention to push his pawn to f6, and then, after 16...Nxf6, to pin the knight after all, piling up on the king with the combined firepower of queen, rooks and three minor pieces. Even now, White needs only two moves to transfer his rook and queen to the h-file, and then it might appear that nothing could save the black king.
Euwe, however, is not easily flustered. Remember that in his lifetime he played more than seventy games with Alekhine, the most feared attacking player of our time.
16...b5!
The beginning of a remarkable plan. Clearly, any defensive maneuvers on the kingside are foredoomed, since they involve pieces with an inconsequential radius of activity (...Rf7, ...Qe7, etc.). But Black does have another defensive resource, and that is counterattack! The bishop at b7, the rook at c8, and the knight at c4 are all well-based; all that remains is to bring up the queen. The basis for this counterattack is Black’s preponderance on the central squares. With 16...b5, Black reinforces the knight on c4 and opens a path for the queen to b6. Still, one cannot help feeling that his operations are too little and too late ...
17.Rh4 Qb6
Pinning white’s queen to the defense of the d-pawn, Black prevents the intended 18.Qh5. After 17.Qh5 Qb6 18.Ne2 Ne5, we get the echo-variation, with the white rook unable to get to h4.
18.e5 Nxe5
19.fxe6 Nxd3
20.Qxd3 Qxe6
All of White’s moves required detailed and precise analysis. Here, for example, the natural 20.exd7 would fail to 20...Qc6.
21.Qxh7+ ...
Thus, White has broken through after all, at an insignificant cost. Once again, Black’s position appears critical.
21...Kf7
22.Bh6 Rh8
If Black’s 16th move was the beginning of his strategic plan of counterattack, then this rook sacrifice is its fundamental tactical stroke, with the aim of drawing the white queen still further afield and decoying it away from the c2 square, meanwhile attacking the king.
23.Qxh8 Rc2
Threatening mate in a few moves: 24...Rxg2+, 25...Qc4+, etc. Detailed analysis, requiring more than just one week’s time, showed that White could have saved himself from mate by finding a few “only” and very difficult moves. First, he has to play 24.d5; if then 24...Qb6+ 25.Kh1 Qf2 26.Rg1 Bxd5, White saves himself with 27.Re4!; and on the immediate 24...Bxd5, not 25.Rd4 — only 25.Rd1! works: after 25...Rxg2+ 26.Kf1 gxh6 neither 27.Rxh6 nor 27.Rxd5: once again, the only move is 27.Qxh6. Black would still have bishop and two pawns for his rook then, which would leave him good winning chances, considering the open position of White’s king. It goes without saying that Geller had no practical chance to find all of these moves over the board.
The analysts also showed that the ...Rf8-h8 idea was actually a little premature, and that ...Rc4 first was better. However, those who love chess will find it difficult to agree with this. Moves like 22...Rh8 are not forgotten.

With the queens and darksquare bishops gone, White is banking on the open c-file and chiefly on the advantage of his “good” bishop over Black’s, which will be hemmed in by its own pawns.

White’s plan is too tame, and insufficient for winning purposes. Black needs only to keep his bishop on the a6-f1 diagonal and his king at e7: most importantly, he must not advance any of his pawns. His last two moves only help his opponent to create a passed pawn.

A surprising and correct decision. Black leaves his knight on f6 without pawn protection and exposes his king to win a pawn. Averbakh’s calculations have convinced him that the pawn cannot be recovered, and Black’s weaknesses will not be much of a problem to him with the queens off. White also has weak pawns of his own on the queenside.

The text is thought to give Black a cramped game, but if a player likes precisely that sort of cramped game”, then he will get better results with it than with a “freer” game. Generally speaking, such evaluations, even though they may sway the opinions of the theoreticians, have far less of an influence on practical tournament games than is commonly supposed.
10.cxd5 exd5
11.Bb2 ...
Trying to improve one’s position, and finding the correct idea to accomplish that end, is one of the bases of chess strategy in every phase of the game. The proper move order also plays an important part, but this falls under the heading of tactical implementation, which of course is a major determinant of the eventual success of the strategic plan.
Here, White’s basic idea is obvious: he needs a good development for both his bishops. He can accomplish this in two ways: either by playing a4 followed by Ba3, or by taking dxc5 bxc5, and then playing c4. Apparently against all logic, however, White places his bishop on a diagonal which is occupied by pawns, seemingly inviting Black to play ...c4 himself, and shut the bishop in for good.
Why? As it turns out, 11.a4 would have been met by 11...cxd4 12.cxd4 Bg4, or 12.exd4 Ne4, attacking the c-pawn; and 11.dxc5 bxc5 12.c4 would allow the reply 12...Rb8, preventing 13.Bb2.
Having played 11.Bb2, however, White can go ahead with his c3-c4, either at once or after the preliminary 12.dxc5 bxc5; so Black’s reply is not merely useful, but almost obligatory. The next phase of the struggle is defined by the new pawn structure: already it has much less to do with the tastes and preferences of the two players than it has to do with their choice of opening. White will set his f- and e-pawns in motion, creating a passed d-pawn and combining the advance of these central pawns with an attack on the f-file. Black, with three pawns to two on his right wing, cannot do too much with them for the moment, since he must first battle the white bishop pair and central preponderance.
11...c4
12.Bc2 Bg4
13.Qe1 Ne4
Black could have altered the course of the struggle here by taking the knight: 13...Bxf3 14.gxf3 Nh5; but he refrained from doing so. The standard explanation — White would be left with the two bishops, a strong pawn center, and the open g-file — could hardly have deterred him, since one bishop would be blocked by its own pawns, and the pawn center is not dangerous for the moment. If 15.e4, for example, then 15...Nf4 16.Kh1 Qh4 17.Bc1 Nd3 18.Bxd3 cxd3 19.Qe3 dxe4 20.fxe4 Rfe8 21.f3 f5 22.e5 Rad8, and the pawn at d3 is taboo.
However, after 13...Bxf3 14.gxf3 Nh5 White could systematically strengthen his position with f4, f3, Qf2, Rae1, Bc1, Kh1 and e4, in that or in some other order, depending on how Black replies (Rg1 might also prove necessary, etc.). A direct attack on the king would be Black’s only possible counter, and it would have had very small chances of success, considering his restricted maneuvering space: the pawn barriers hamper the mobility of his knights.
Petrosian continues following his own line, figuring that as long as he has made no unsound moves, nor upset the positional balance, he will not risk finding himself in a losing position.

Black prevents the maneuver 21.a4 and 22.Ba3, and reminds his opponent that he has a queenside pawn majority.
21.Bd1 ...
We have grown accustomed to seeing this bishop on d3 or c2 — or b1, at least — participating in a kingside attack. Reshevsky undertakes a roundabout maneuver which further strengthens White’s position and prepares the advance of his pawns, hitherto impossible.

25.Rfe1 Re6
Reshevsky’s clever play combined with Petrosian’s iron logic make this game one of the tournament’s jewels. Black must stop White’s pawns, so Petrosian gives up the exchange at a spot of his own choosing, freeing e7 for the transfer of his knight to d5. Of course, Black gets good compensation for the exchange: his knight is much stronger on d5, as is his bishop, which no longer has an opponent. Note that here, or even on the previous move, White might have launched a direct attack with h4 followed by h5 and Rg3, with good winning chances; but he expects to win a different way.
26.a4 ...
Provoking 26...b4, when there would follow 27.d5 Rxd5 28.Bxe6 fxe6 29.Qxc4 (28.Qxc4 Rdxe5 would have been weaker), but Petrosian perseveres with his plan.
26...Ne7

Keeping an eye on the pawn at c4, and preparing to return the exchange — for a pawn. On 28.Qf2 Nd5 29.Rf3 b4 is unpleasant.
28...Nd5
29.Rf3 Bd3
30.Rxd3 cxd3
31.Qxd3 b4
Black, naturally, had no choice, since taking the a-pawn would have been senseless. But now it is White who must solve a difficult psychological problem: should he exchange on b4, which practically guarantees the draw, or advance the pawn, driving out the knight and obtaining winning chances, as well as losing ones?
With no time left in which to calculate variations, it is understandable that Reshevsky chose the simpler continuation. After 32.c4 Nb6 33.Rc1 Nxa4 34.Ba1 Qc6 or 33.d5 exd5 34.c5 Nxa4 35.Bd4 Rc8 36.Qf3 Qe6, White’s pawns would have been blockaded, and Black’s would become extremely dangerous.
32.cxb4 b4
32...Nxb4 33.Qb3 Nd5 was also possible, or 33.Qb5 Qxb5 34.axb5 Nd3 35.Re2 Rb8 36.Rd2 Rxb5 37.Rxd3 Rxb2 38.d5, with a draw.

5.Bg5 c5
6.d5 Na6
A lot has already happened in the first six moves. Taking advantage of the white queen’s bishop’s development to g5, instead of the usual e3, where it participates in the struggle for d4, Black quickly counterattacked the white center with 5...c5. Since 6.d5 kept Black’s knight from developing to c6, Najdorf now intends to bring it to c7, so he can prepare ...b7-b5 with ...a7-a6. This costs a lot of time, however, and the result obtained is disproportionately small, compared with the amount of effort expended. The knight occupies a passive position on c7, where it remains unemployed for some time. In the end, it nearly costs Black the game.

The positions of Black’s pieces give the e- and f-pawns an insensate urge to advance. White is acquiring more and more territory; the pawn now at b5 is hardly compensation for Black’s cramped position: for instance, compare the rooks at f8 and f1.

21.b3 Nb5

Small advantages, patiently accumulated, have grown into a sizable stack; now with this move, White begins his search for the decisive strengthening of his position. The threat is 23...-- 24.Nf4 g5 25.Ne6 gxh4 26.Nxf8; additionally, his last move helped fix the black e- and f-pawns on dark squares.
Still, White might have given some thought to the transfer of his bishop to a different diagonal. It has already done its work here by inducing ...f6, and might have caused Black considerable grief after 23.Be1. 23.Ra1 was also possible, but although an immediate 23...f5 would not work in view of 24.e5 dxe5 25.d6+ Kh8 26.dxe7 etc., White would always have had to consider an eventual ...f5 anyway.
23...Bh6
24.fxg6 hxg6
25.e5 Bxc4
26.bxc4 dxe5
27.Qd3 ...
Why did White sacrifice that pawn? Can’t Black begin a counterattack now? Not yet; and, meanwhile, White needs only two or three moves — Nc3 and Rb1, for example — to take over all the key points on the queenside, and then to pick up the c5- or the e7-pawn. The knight’s poor placement at a8 helps White greatly in the execution of this plan.
27...Kh7
28.Nc3 Qb3
White’s last two moves weren’t bad, but they could have been a little better: for instance, 27.Bf2 Rc8 28.Qd3 Kg7 29.h4. Now Najdorf finds a way to introduce tactical complications, and, more importantly, to exchange queens, which eases his defense.
29.Rb1 e4
30.Rxb3 exd3
31.Rb7 Kg8
32.Kf2 ...
Of course White does not take the pawn, which would allow the knight out of its distant corner at last.

Practically all of White’s advantage disappears after the exchange of rooks. Better was 34.Rxe7 Rb3 35.Bxf6 or 34...Bd6 35.Re6 Be5 36.Bxf6 Bxc3 37.Bxc3 Rb3 38.Ba5!
White overestimated the strength of the pawn at d3 in rejecting this continuation, although his pawn on d5 would have been much more dangerous.
The best line of all would have been 33.Bg3, instead of 33.Kf3, offering to exchange bishops. However, White had overlooked Black’s reply, 33...Rb8.

(Nimzoindian Defense)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6
3.Nc3 Bb4
4.Nf3 ...
In the overwhelming majority of this tournament’s Nimzo-Indians, White continued with 4.e3: such is the pull of fashion — which, as I suspected, was to persist long after this tournament. Gligoric’s choice, 4.Nf3, is also quite playable. Although Black managed to equalize swiftly and even to seize the initiative in this game, Gligoric himself was to blame for that.
4...b6
5.Bg5 h6
6.Bh4 g5
7.Bg3 Ne4
8.Qc2 Bb7
9.e3 d6
Hasn’t Taimanov blundered a piece — 10.Qa4+ Nc6 11.d5? No, since the white knight is insufficiently defended — 11...Nxc3.
10.Bd3 Bxc3+
11.bxc3 f5
12.0-0 ...
Gligoric is not afraid of the further advance of Black’s pawns, correctly judging that this will only weaken Black’s position. So he invites 12...h5, and where is the player who could resist such temptation? Taimanov saw just in time, however, that after 12...h5? 13.h4!, it is not Black who has the attack, at any rate. So he increases the pressure on e4 by means of the quiet maneuver Nb8-d7-f6, which results in a slight advantage for Black.
However, White might have cast doubt on Black’s whole system of development if he had played something more concrete than his clever castling idea: that being 12.d5, cutting communications between the bishop at b7 and the knight at e4. After 12...exd5, White would play 13.Nd4 (which would also meet most of Black’s other replies), with a very powerful attack: he threatens, among other things, simply 14.f3.
Though I know I’m anticipating, I still can’t resist mentioning that less than two years after this game, in the 22nd USSR Championship, Taimanov reached precisely this position against Keres, for which the Estonian had prepared (as he himself tells us) the improvement 12.d5! Keres’ idea and the author’s thus coincided — and immediately diverged: White answered 12...exd5, not with 13.Nd4, but with 13.cxd5 Bxd5, and only then 14.Nd4 Nd7 15.f3 Nxg3 16.hxg3 Qf6 17.Bxf5 0-0-0 18.Qa4, with an excellent position: Black had to lay down his arms in 29 moves.

Taimanov has kept his pawn octave whole, while White’s is slightly marred in two places — which more or less defines the extent of Black’s positional advantage. All the minor pieces having been traded off in the preceding phase of the game, now the pawns’ turn comes: twelve of them will disappear in the next twelve moves! This statistic is also a reflection of the essential point of White’s strategy: to denude the black king and also to give Black some queen-side pawn weaknesses with the break c4-c5.

The pawn skirmishes have gone in White’s favor: Black now has a weakness at d6, and his king is starting to feel the draft.
25.e4 Rf7
White had planned the further advance of his e-pawn, opening the diagonal for the queen to invade at g6. At the moment, this would not work, since on 26.e5 Black gives check and takes (26...Qc5+) off the e-pawn with his queen. More pawn exchanges follow shortly, and the game begins to look like a draw.

(Catalan Opening)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6

4.Bg2 dxc4
5.Nf3 ...
The Catalan only appears to be a harmless opening: in reality, it conceals a number of subtleties, which is why it is so often played by such as Keres, Smyslov and Petrosian. White’s move, 5.Nf3, is one such nuance. Usually, check is given here, and the pawn recaptured, but this allows Black to develop his bishop via d7 to c6. Now, however, White has the choice, depending upon circumstances, of recovering his pawn by Nf3-e5xc4 or Nb1-d2xc4, or going back to Qd1-a4xc4.
If Black plays it like a Queen’s Gambit, and tries to equalize” by means of the standard maneuver ...c7-c5, the fianchettoed bishop unleashes tremendous power: for example, 5...c5 6.0-0 Nc6 7.Qa4 Bd7 8.dxc5 Na5 9.Qc2 Bxc5 10.Ne5 Rc8 11.Nc3 b5 12.Bg5, and White has an outstanding game.
5...Bb4+
A new line. Black wants to draw the bishop out to d2 to prevent the knight from using that square. On 6.Nbd2 White was afraid of 6...c3 7.bxc3 Bxc3, when Black retains his pawn; but it would be interesting to see what would happen after 8.Ba3 Bxa1 9.Qxa1.
6.Bd2 Be7
7.Qc2 ...
By not giving check, White avoids 7...Bd7 and 8...Bc6. Now if 7...Bd7 he intends 8.Ne5, removing Black’s lightsquare bishop and thereby strengthening his own.
7...Bd7
Anyway! On 8.Ne5, Black replies 8...Nc6, allowing his pawns to be shattered: after 9.Nxc6 Bxc6 10.Bxc6+ bxc6 11.Qxc4, however, Black has 11...Qd5, forcing the trade of queens, which levels the game completely. If 9.Qxc4 in this line, 9...Nxe5 10.dxe5 Nd5 11.Bxd5 exd5 12.Qxd5 Qc8 13.0-0 Bc6, with a fine attack for the sacrificed pawn.

The transition phase from opening to middlegame has arrived. White does not wish to continue the fight with an enemy piece on e4, nor does Black care to allow White’s knight to get to e5. Unable to reach an agreement as to the placing of these two pieces, both sides repeat moves...

After obtaining a good position with Black in the first round against Najdorf, Reshevsky repeats the opening exactly against Averbakh. Here Najdorf played 11.a4; Averbakh plays the more logical 11.Re1, which prepares 12.e4. The first skirmish flares, concluding some ten moves later with White on top. Along the way, however, he will have to occupy e4 with a piece, in order to prevent Black’s pawn from doing so.
11.Re1 Rd8
12.Qc2 e5
13.Ng5 ...

14.d5 ...
Black counterattacked White’s pawn center, playing 11...Rd8 to prevent White’s d4-d5, but his plan failed: the rook had to go back in order to defend the f-pawn, and White advanced his d-pawn. The position also admits of a different, and sharper, handling: 14.Bd3 would maintain the tension at c5 and e5, force a weakening of Black’s king’s wing, and prepare an attack with his pieces: for example, 14...h6 15.Ne4 Nxe4 16.Bxe4 cxd4 17.cxd4 exd4 18.Bb2.
14...Na5
15.Ba2 h6
16.Ne4 Nxe4
17.Qxe4 Bd7
White threatens to play f2-f4, when taking the pawn would be inadvisable for Black, since it would open up the game in White’s favor. Defending the pawn with ...f7-f6 would also be poor in view of Bb1, when the white queen will invade at h7. So Black begins the construction of a defensive perimeter based on his pawn at e5. 17...Bd7 is necessary to meet the threat of 18.f4, for now Black could reply 18...exf4 19.exf4? Rae8; the move is also useful for control of the diagonal a4-e8.
18.c4 b6
19.Qd3 Rae8
20.e4 Qd6
An audit of the last ten moves would show a strong positive balance for .White, with good showings in all his ventures: he has gotten in 20.e4, and closed the center, so that now he is ready to storm the king’s position; and in the event of an endgame, he is ready with his protected passed pawn at d5. On the negative side, of course, there is that bishop at a2, but that can always be redeployed via b1 to d3. How is Black to meet the impending attack on his king? He must ready himself to weather the storm by placing his pawns on dark squares, his rooks on the e-file, and his knight at d6, where it blockades the pawn and covers the light squares.
21.Qg3 Re7
22.Bd2 Nb7
23.f4 Rfe8
24.Bc3 f6
Black shores e5 up with might and main, pressing simultaneously on e4 in the hope of inducing f4-f5.
25.f5 ...
Correctly evaluating the position, Averbakh does not capture on e5, even though he would hold a clear advantage after 25.fxe5 fxe5 26.Rf1, followed by the doubling of the rooks on the f-file, since one of the black rooks would have to remain tied to the defense of the e-pawn. The reason he didn’t take the pawn is that Black would have answered 25.fxe5 with 25...Rxe5, and the black knight which would soon enter d6 would be not a bit weaker than a white rook. Now, with Black’s bishop immured, White can bring up his rooks and push his g- and h-pawns.
25...Rb8
26.Bd2 ...
Before beginning his attack, White would like to ascertain which direction Black’s king will move in order to meet the threatened 27.Bxh6.
26...Kh8
Now everything is in readiness for White to begin his pawn storm (with h2-h4 and g2-g4) immediately. Of course he must watch out for his opponent’s play, but still Black would have had a very difficult time of it. White’s next move, however, slows the pace of the attack, allowing Reshevsky to slip in a little reminder of his own counterchances (his extra pawn on the queenside, the possible attack on the pawn at c4, and the weakness at b3).

Practically speaking, the shortest game of the tournament: even though it did continue until the 41st move, after this check Szabo might as well have resigned, since in effect he is now giving Keres odds of pawn and move (odds once given by masters to first-category players in the handicap tourneys of Chigorin’s day). One wonders how, after prolonged consideration, Szabo could blunder a pawn as early as move five. Keres was more than a little amazed himself: he spent fifteen minutes considering his reply.
5...b5
6.Qc2 ...
The whole problem is that White has not yet played e2-e3. With the bishop’s diagonal open, ...b7-b5 would require extensive analysis, since White could then simply take the pawn with his knight and meet ...Bd7 with, Bxc4. But now his choice is either to remain a pawn down, or to give up a piece: 6.Nxb5 Bd7 7.Nxc7+ Qxc7 8.Qc2, hoping to pick up the c-pawn as well eventually. Even in that highly problematical event, however, he would still have only two pawns for his piece.
6...Nc6
7.e4 e6
8.Bg5 ...
A pawn down, Szabo panics: why not 8.Be3, when his two center pawns, e4 and d4, promise White plenty of opportunities to complicate? Szabo’s 8.Bg5 gives up a second pawn, in hopes that if it is taken he will gain several tempi to complete his development. However, Keres easily repels the attack, remaining two pawns up.

19. Euwe—Smyslov
(Grunfeld Defense)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 g6
3.g3 Bg7
4.Bg2 d5
5.cxd5 Nxd5
6.e4 Nb6
7.Ne2 c5
Smyslov makes frequent use of this line of the Grunfeld, where Black attacks the center pawns with ...c5 and ...e6, trades off on d5 and blockades the pawn by planting his knight at d6. Isolated and blockaded though it may be, the white d-pawn remains very strong nevertheless. Black must always be prepared for its advance, especially considering how difficult it will be for him to actually get either one of his knights from b6 or b8 to d6. The outcome of this game will depend on whether White finds an appropriate moment to advance the pawn to d6 and secure it there. If he can, then he will have the advantage; if not, Black will obtain good counterchances.
In my personal opinion, the system looks good for White. It is possible that Smyslov now shares this opinion, since, despite the successful outcome of this game, he did not employ the system again, either at Zurich or at any other tournament thereafter.
8.d5 e6
9.0-0 0-0
10.a4 ...
Smyslov is dealing with a great expert on the Grunfeld. At the Amsterdam 1950 tournament, Euwe played a similar game against Pilnik, continuing here with 10.Nbc3. In the tournament book Euwe noted that the move was not good, and recommended the continuation 10.a4! Na6 11.Na3 exd5 12.exd5 Nb4 13.Nc3! Smyslov goes into the line nonetheless, which gives this game added interest.
Curiously enough, in Game 129 (Round 19) against Keres, Euwe played 10.Nec3, and in his notes calls this move stronger than 10 a4.
Both moves seem adequate to me.
10...Na6
11.Na3 exd5
12.exd5 Bf5
13.Nc3 ...
13.a5 would have been a trifle more accurate, but Euwe was expecting the knight to go to d7 on its own, with: 13.Nc3 Nb4 14.Be3 Nd7 15.Qd2.
13...Nb4
14.Be3 Rc8
Smyslov plays an active defense: now he threatens to occupy d3 with a piece, severing the enemy communications between flanks. Advancing his pawn tod6, with the exchange sacrifice that follows, appears to be the logical end of White’s entire setup, but it would have had more effect after 15.a5.
15.d6 Bd3
16.Bxb7 ...
The strategic idea is correct, but its tactical formulation is wrong. Now 16.a5 was necessary in order to meet 16...Bxf1 17.Kxf1 Nd7 18.Bxb7 Rb8 with 19.a6. After the text, an interesting battle of the pieces ensues, where calculation reigns supreme, and where Black’s chances are objectively no worse.
16...Rb8
17.Bg2 Bxf1
A brave choice. Many would have preferred 17...Qxd6, which equalizes, and is in any event easier to calculate.
18.Kxf1 Nd7
19.Nc4 Ne5
20.Nxe5 Bxe5
21.Bxc5 Qa5
Two pawns, one of them passed and on the sixth rank, are sufficient compensation for the exchange; the maneuver Smyslov begins with this move, however, underscores the weakness of the pawn at d6. 22.Nb5 is now impossible, in view of 22...Rxb5, so the bishop has to retreat.
22.Be3 Rfd8
23.Ne4 Bxd6
The scales tip first one way, then the other: just when Black has obtained the upper hand, Euwe begins a complex combination with a pretty
zwischenzug
, 26.Nd7.
24.Nf6+ Kh8
As will later become clear, 24...Kg7 was better: it is important in one variation that the king defend the pawn on f7.
25.Bd4 Be5
The picture looks hopeless for White, but his next move is quite pretty.
26.Nd7 ...
The idea is to decoy the rook onto an unprotected square. Now if 26...Rxd7 27.Bxe5+ Qxe5 28.Qxd7 Qxb2 29.Re1, and two of Black’s pawns are
en prise
; also poor is 26...Bxd4 27.Qxd4+ Kg8 28.Nf6+ Kh8 29.Nd5+ Kg8 30.Ne7+ Kf8 31.Qh8+ Kxe7 32.Re1+.
26...f6
After 26...Qa6+ 27.Kg1 Bxd4 28.Qxd4+ f6 or 28...Kg8, White obtains the better endgame with 29.Nxb8 Rxd4 30.Nxa6.
27.Bxe5 fxe5
28.Qd2 ...
Smyslov’s determination to play for complications has borne fruit: Euwe fails to find the better move 28.Qd6, whose main continuation runs: 28...Rb6 29.Qe7 Nc6 30.Qf6+ Kg8 31.Rd1, which threatens the killing 32.Bd5+. Black would be forced to trade queens and try to save himself in a difficult pawn-down endgame: 28...Qa6+ 29.Qxa6 Nxa6 30.Nxb8 Rxb8 31.Re1.
28...Rbc8
With the queen on d6, White could have continued 29.Qf6+ and 30.Bh3 here (forcing 30...Qa6+), traded queens, recovered the exchange, and come out a pawn up.
29.Kg1 Qc5
A brilliant resource which White overlooked. Black’s queen reenters the fray elegantly and decisively, threatening to win the pinned knight.
30.Bh3 Qe7
31.Qe2 ...
Euwe thinks 31.Rd1 would have been better, but I do not see any great difference: 31...Rc7 32.Qe1 Nc6 33.b4 Qxb4 34.Nxe5 Qxe1+ 35.Rxe1 Nxe5 36.Rxe5 Rd2, and Black must win.
31...Rxd7
32.Bxd7 Qxd7
33.Qxe5+ Kg8
Now Black is a piece up, and the win is, as they say, a matter of technique. In the present instance, however, the technique will be anything but simple; for the piece White has, besides two pawns, some other chances as well: his king is better sheltered, and Black’s knight has no support points in the center.
In general, Black’s plan will be to avoid exchanging queenside pawns, to find shelter for his king, to bring his knight to the kingside, and finally, to attack the white pawns at f2 and b2 (or b3) with overwhelming force.
The fulfilment of this plan requires exceptional restraint, deep calculation, and rapid assessment of the positions that occur along the way.
34.Qe4 a5
35.h4 Qd5
36.Qg4 Rf8
37.Rd1 Qf3
38.Qc4+ Qf7
39.Qc5 Qf5
40.Qc4+ Qf7
41.Qc5 Qf5
42.Qc4+ Kg7
These last moves were played in grievous time-pressure, and Black has thus far achieved nothing beyond pinning the white queen to the protection of the f2 square. Now he must secure c6 for the transfer of his knight.
43.Qd4+ Qf6
44.Qc5 Rf7
45.Rd2 Qe7
The threat of 46...Qe1+ gains Black a tempo to regroup.
46.Qc3+ Rf6
47.Rd4 Nc6
48.Rd5 ...
White could have gotten a third pawn for the piece by 48.Rf4 Qe5 49.Rxf6 Qxc3 50.Rxg6+ Kxg6 51.bxc3, but he would have had a lost ending all the same. Euwe gives the line 51...Ne5 52.Kf1 Kf5 53.Ke2 Ke4 54.h5 h6, and White’s pawns die.
48...Qe6
49.Rc5 h5
50.b3 Kf7
51.Rb5 Qd7
52.Kg2 Qe7
53.Qc4+ Kg7
54.Qd3 Kh6
55.Rd5 Rf7
56.Rd6 Ne5
Gradually, the knight works its way to g4.
57.Qe3+ Kh7
58.Rb6 ...
58.Rd5 would not have helped either, in view of 58...Rf5 59.Rxa5 Qb7+ 60.f3 Nc4. The text leads to an immediate loss.
58...Qc7
After 58...Ng4 59.Qxe7 Rxe7 60.b4, White might have had a slim chance; but now 59...Ng4 is threatened, and if 59.f3, then 59...Qc2+ decides.
WHITE RESIGNED
Smyslov showed a high level of mastery and an incredible will to win in every phase of this tense game.
20. Stahlberg—Geller
(Kinq’s Indian)
1.d4 Nf6
2.Nf3 g6
3.g3 Bg7
4.Bg2 0-0
5.0-0 d6
6.Nbd2 ...
An unusual and somewhat passive system Stahlberg employs occasionally against the King’s Indian. The e-pawn is kept at home, and the c-pawn advanced but one square; the d-pawn is traded off, as White refrains absolutely from either creating a pawn center or participating in the fight for the central squares. Not infrequently this results in a great deal of maneuvering, followed by exchanges, and a draw; but for this game, Geller will have none of it. Instead, he wages a very active campaign for more territory, first on the kingside, and then over the entire board.
6...Nc6
7.c3 e5
8.dxe5 dxe5
9.Nb3 Qe7
10.Be3 Rd8
11.Qc1 ...
The first result of his passive strategy is that White cannot move his queen to c2 (11.Qc2) in view of 11...Bf5.
11...e4
12.Nfd4 Ne5
13.Bg5 Nc4
14.Nc2 c6
Stahlberg’s maneuverings are not dictated by any strategic plan, but rather by practical guidelines he has derived from his enormous tournament experience and chess-sense: advance no pawns, create no glaring weaknesses, show not the slightest aggressive intent; but meanwhile, do not avoid exchanges, and be ready to set a tactical snare at any moment. So now, despite a whole series of planless (but also harmless) moves, White’s position is not yet bad, on the whole. Geller shows great resourcefulness and determination in breaking down Stahlberg’s skilled — and not entirely toothless — defense.
15.Ne3 Nd6
16.Rd1 h6
Now, while the knight temporarily blocks the diagonal, Black breaks the pin, puts his king on h7, and then plays ...f5.
17.Bf4 Nfe8
18.Nf1 Kh7
19.Qc2 f5
20.Be3 Be6
21.Bd4 Nf6
Black’s advantage has crystallized somewhat: White’s pieces are corralled, his lightsquare bishop is locked out of play, and the powerful chain of Black’s kingside pawns is always ready to be set in motion. All of this put together, however, is not yet enough to win with. Black undertakes a queenside pawn advance as well, in order to restrict still further his opponent’s pieces; then he trades off all White’s active pieces, leaving him only the bishop on g2 and the knight on f1. Stahlberg maintains his composure, and holds to his passive course, believing himself to be running no danger of losing yet.
22.Bc5 b6
23.Bxd6 Rxd6
For trading’s sake, Stahlberg does not grudge even the dark-square bishop, so important for White against the King’s Indian. This might eventually have cost White the game.
24.Rxd6 Qxd6
25.Rd1 Qc7
26.Ne3 c5
27.Nd2 Rd8
28.Ndf1 Rxd1
29.Nxd1 Qf7
30.Nde3 ...
A transparent trap: if the bishop takes the pawn (30...Bxa2), White cuts off its retreat by 31.c4.
30...b5
31.a3 a5
32.Nd2 Nd5
Since Geller plans to close up the game, he ought not to exchange his last knight; on the other hand, having traded it off now, he ought not to close up the game.
33.Nxd5 Bxd5
34.e3 ...
Stahlberg breaks his rule of no pawn advances, and wrongly so: nothing required that he weaken his d3 square and give the black queen an inroad. A better plan would have been 34.Nf1, 35.Ne3 and 36.Qd2.
34...c4
35.Bf1 a4
36.Bg2 Qd7
37.g4 ...
To give the knight a way out, via f1, to g3 — and, as we shall see, White will soon get the opportunity to avail himself of it.
37...Be6
38.gxf5 gxf5
39.Nf1 ...
Wearying of his dull drawing play, Stahlberg wishes to hurry matters by transferring the knight via g3 and e2 to d4. At this moment, a crevice appears in his defensive wall; 39.Bf1 was the proper move to keep the queen out of d3.
39...Qd3
40.Qc1 h5
Geller’s last move before the time control destroys the fruits of all his labors, throwing away a well-earned win. He could have exploited the power of his two bishops with 40...b4, putting White in a hopeless predicament: 41.axb4 a3 42.bxa3 Bxc3, and Black’s pawn will cost White a piece; or 41.cxb4 c3, and Black gets to the a-pawn.
41.Ng3 h4
Now the break would come too late, since f1 has been cleared for White’s bishop: he could answer 41...b4 with 42.Bf1, driving away the queen.
A move earlier wins; a move later draws — that’s what the time element means in chess.
42.Nh5 Bf7

21. Boleslavsky—Kotov
(Queen’s Gambit)

3.Nf3 Nf6
4.e3 e6
5.Bxc4 c5
6.0-0 a6
7.Qe2 cxd4
7...b5 is usually played here, but Kotov holds back with this, intending to play it only after White’s Nc3; if then a2-a4, Black can reply ...b5-b4 with tempo.
Black’s central exchange aims at securing an unhampered development for his pieces, followed by the establishment of a piece on d5. This relieves White of his main headache in the Queen’s Gambit Accepted, namely: the development of his queen’s bishop; it also opens up the e-file.
Boleslavsky amasses a great pile of pieces in the center, and then sets off some interesting complications, with the d-pawn acting as a fuse.
8.exd4 Be7
9.Nc3 b5
10.Bb3 Bb7
11.Bg5 0-0
12.Rfe1 ...
A typical move in this opening: White attacks not only the pawn at e6 but also the bishop behind it at e7. For example, if 12...Nbd7 13.Rad1 Nb6, White can already play 14.Bxe6 fxe6 15.Qxe6+ Rf7 16.Ne5.
Kotov therefore tries to liquidate the threat of Bxe6 as quickly as possible by exchanging or else driving the bishop away from b3.
12...Nc6
13.Rad1 Na5
All the commentators agreed this move was a mistake, since it allowed White to carry out the pretty breakthrough that follows, with its lively play leading to a win for White, some thirty moves hence. Stahlberg, and Euwe as well in his earlier commentaries, suggest that 13...Nb4 was the required response here. However, Rauzer showed in some rather old analysis that the continuation 13...Nb4 14.d5 Nbxd5 15.Nxd5 Bxd5 16.Bxd5 Nxd5 17.Bxe7 Qxe7 18.Rxd5 favors White. Najdorf therefore recommended 13...Nd5 14.Nxd5 Bxg5 15.Nc3 Nb4, a view later adopted by Euwe also.
We should like to go a little more deeply into the concept of “mistake”, as it is applied to chess. To begin with, the mistakenness of 13...Na5 was only demonstrated as a result of White’s clever and by no means obvious continuation. His advantage finally boiled down to his possession of a strong bishop against Black’s knight in an endgame: certainly not all that simple, nor all that much!
Secondly, it’s not clear how the battle might have gone after 13...Nd5, since White had the secret weapon 14.Nxd5 Bxg5 15.Nb6. If Black plays 15...Rb8, instead of taking the knight, he loses the exchange after 16.Nxg5 and 17.Nd7; and on 15...Ra7 16.d5 is very strong. If he takes the knight on b6 (15...Qxb6), however, Black will be in a real predicament after 16.Nxg5: 16...h6 loses to the sacrifice at f7 (17.Nxf7) followed by 18.Qxe6, and there seems to be no clear defense to the thematic push d4-d5, since 16...Nxd4 fails against 17.Qd3 Nf5 18.Nxe6 fxe6 19.Bxe6+ Kh8 20.Bxf5, or 18...Qc6 19.Nf4, etc.
Had the game in fact taken such a course, then 13...Nd5 would have been labeled the mistake, and 13...Na5 recommended instead, since it does not appear to be too dangerous.
Black’s difficulties appear to have another cause entirely. Compared with Black’s pieces, White’s have made three extra moves! — both rooks to central files, and the bishop to an attacking diagonal. If there is logic in chess, then those three powerful developing moves must tell somehow. It is a grandmaster’s task to demonstrate White’s advantage, and in this case the proof was of the complicated combinative sort.
Such melding of logic and combinative powers is the hallmark of Boleslavsky.
14.d5 Nxb3
It is easy to see that taking the d-pawn with bishop, knight or pawn would cost a piece.
15.dxe6 ...
15...Qb6
If the bishop takes the knight at f3 (15...Bxf3), there follows 16.exf7+ Kh8 17.Rxd8 Bxe2 18.Rxa8 Rxa8 19.Rxe2 and Black has two pieces
en prise
; when one falls, White will be two pawns ahead. If that’s not enough for White, he can also play 16.Qxf3 Nd4 17.Qe3.
16.axb3 fxe6
17.Nd4 ...
White does not need the pawn so much as the square e6.
17...Bd6
18.Qxe6+ Kh8
19.Nf3 Rad8
20.Bf4 ...
Credit is due White also for selecting precisely this out of all the possible continuations here. The phrase which comes to mind is: “Black’s two bishops and good development in an open position fully compensate his pawn minus.” But now, it turns out, the two bishops will disappear, and the bad knight remain, compensating nothing — but all this had to be foreseen!
20...Bxf3
20...Rfe8 21.Rxd6 Rxe6 22.Rxb6 Rxb6 23.Bc7 was bad too.
21.Rxd6 Rd6
22.Qxd6 Qxd6
23.Bxd6 Re8
24.Rxe8+ Nxe8
25.Be5 ...
Now Boleslavsky must demonstrate his endgame skill. White begins with a typical technique in such bishop/knight endings: placing his bishop three squares distant from the enemy knight on an opposite- colored square, thereby totally depriving the knight of moves.
Getting out via f6 would be absolutely hopeless, since the knight/bishop ending with an extra pawn is a dead win for White.
Boleslavsky continues by fixing the a- and b-pawns on light squares and bringing up his king; then, after a few more preparatory moves, he can pick off the a-pawn with his knight.
25...Bc6 26.b4 h5 27.f3 Kh7 28.Ne2 g5 29.Kf2 h4 30.g3 hxg3+ 31.hxg3 Kg6 32.g4 Bb7 33.Ke3 Bc6 34.Nc3 Bb7 35.Ne4 Bd5 36.Nc5 Kf7 37.Nxa6 Ke6 38.Bc3 Ba8 39.Nc5+ Kf7 40.Ne4 Kg6 41.Be5 Bd5 42.Nd2 Kf7

1.d4 e6

3.c4 b6
4.Nc3 Bb7
5.Bg5 h6
6.Bxf6 Qxf6
7.e4 ...
Other things being equal, it’s always advantageous to occupy the center with pawns. Unwilling to lose time retreating the bishop, Geller decides to see whether the two bishops really do counterbalance a strong pawn center.
7...Bb4
8.Bd3 c5
Black opens the center, to give his bishops more room.
9.0-0 cxd4
10.Nb5 Qd8
The best defense to the threat of 11.Nc7+.
11.Nbxd4 0-0
12.Qe2 Nc6
13.Rad1 Nxd4
14.Nxd4 ...
In many variations of the Nimzo-Indian, an exchange on c3 leaves White with the two bishops. In this case, it is Black who has the two bishops, but White has the better position. He has a lead in development, with prospects of capitalizing on it, since Black has a backward pawn at d7 and the weak square d6. Geller occupies d6 with his knight, and then uses his rook to fix the weak pawn at d7. Boleslavsky’s counterplay is based on his strong bishop, which will sweep a long diagonal after White’s coming e4-e5, and on the possibility of opening the g- file for his major pieces.
14...Bc5
15.Bc2 Rc8
16.e5 Qg5
17.f4 ...
White throws himself into his assault on the d-pawn, thinking that the fianchettoed queen’s bishop will be no danger to him, but that bishop will avenge the insult later. 17.Be4, liquidating the long-diagonal threats once and for all, would have been a good idea.
17...Qe7
Now if 18.Be4 Ba6 19.b3 d5 20.exd6 Qxd6, and Black rids himself, not only of his weak pawn, but of White’s knight as well.
18.Kh1 f5
19.Nb5 a6
20.Nd6 Bxd6
21.Rxd6 Rc6
22.Rfd1 ...
Geller’s decision to trade rooks here is contrary to logic. White is pressing on the d-pawn, and for this two rooks are clearly better than one. After the rook’s retreat, followed by 23.Rfd1, one of Black’s pieces would be forced Into a passive position: either ...Rc7, ...Bc8, or ...Rd8.
22...Rxd6
23.Rxd6 Bc6
24.b4 ...
This queenside diversion (b2-b4, followed by a2-a4 and b4-b5) would have been a good idea under more peaceful circumstances —with the queens gone, for example. This was a good time to think of defense with 24.Qe3 or 24.Kg1; but Geller, more from inertia than for any other reason, continues to press, hoping to force a win from a position not yet ripe for it. Now Boleslavsky lays his trumps on the table.
24...Qh4
First comes this attack on the pawn at f4, exploiting the back-rank mate threat: if 25.b5, for example, then Black takes twice.
25.Rd4 g5
Another pair of trumps: the g-file is opened, and Black also demonstrates that the rook at d4 is no defender of the pawn at f4.
26.Kg1 ...
The sudden turn of events has affected Geller’s nerve and self- possession. There was no need to give the pawn away: 26.Qe3 was still playable. Even though White has to submit to a powerful attack — 26.Qe3 gxf4 27.Rxf4 Qg5 28.Qf2 Kh8 — Black has no forced win yet.
26...gxf4
27.Qf2 Qe7
28.a3 Qg7
A pretty maneuver.
29.Rxf4 Qxe5
30.Rd4 Rf7
31.Bd3 ...
With queens exchanged, the endgame would also be hopeless for White. Both sides were now in time-pressure, but Boleslavsky plays very exactly.
31...f4
The pawns start to roll: this is the beginning of the end.
32.Bf1 Qf6
33.Rd2 b5
34.c5 Qa1
Pushing the e-pawn to e3 would have decided at once. In time- pressure, Black wants to trade queens first.
35.Qh4 Qf6
36.Qxf6 Rxf6
37.Kf2 e5
38.g3 fxg3+
In his time-pressure, Geller probably failed to notice that his bishop on f1 was hanging.

For this game, the chessboard becomes a battleground of principle between Smyslov and Stahlberg, who are repeating their game from the Budapest 1950 tournament. There, Stahlberg continued with 11...Ba4, only to discover, after 12.Nxf6+, that he could not recapture with his queen (12...Qxf6) because of 13.Bxa4 and 14.Qc4, winning a pawn. So here, he delays the exchange of light- square bishops for two moves, but without achieving any substantial improvement.
White has a palpable advantage in space and complete freedom of maneuver, while Black’s bishop remains under attack by White’s knight and requires the queen’s protection; the black knight’s movements are quite restricted too. Under these circumstances, the slightest misstep could be fatal for Black.

White threatened 17...-- 18.Nxf6+, forcing the pawn recapture, since on 18...Qxf6 19.c5 would win the b-pawn. 17...Qc7 does not meet this threat, however.
But it is hard to criticize Stahlberg for not playing the more accurate 17...Rd7, since in this case also White would have many ways to strengthen his position, such as 18.a4, or 18.Nc5 and 19.Nd3, to say nothing of the simple 18.Nxf6+, followed by Ne5 and Re1-e3-h3 for an attack.
18.Nxf6+ gxf6
19.Qe3 Kg7
Smyslov’s logical play has been making Black’s defense more and more difficult. He cannot take the c-pawn, of course, because of 20.Qh6, which leaves him no time to defend the f6-pawn: for example, 19...Nxc4 20.Qh6 Qe7 21.Nh4, threatening 22.Nf5 and 22.Rd3. Nor does 19...Kh8 save him, in view of 20.Qh6 Nd7 21.d5, and the exchange of pawns brings White’s rook to d5 and thence to h5; or 20...Qe7 21.Nh4. After the text, White must bring his knight to g4 in order to continue his attack — but how?
20.Ne5 ...
A beautiful move, captivating in its simplicity: since the only route to g4 lies through e5, the knight runs full tilt onto the bayonets — what could be simpler! The point is, of course, that taking the knight would open the door for White’s queen and rook to set up a mating attack: 20...fxe5 21.Qg5+, followed by 22.Qf6+ and 23.Re3. (In this line we find a pretty forcing maneuver to keep the king in the corner which you may find useful: 21.Qg5+ Kh8 22.Qf6+ Kg8 23.Re3 Rfe8 24.Qh6 — a quiet move — 24...Kh8 25.Rg3, threatening Qg7 mate, and on 25...Rg8, obviously, there follows. 26.Qf6+.)
20...Qe7
21.Ng4 Rg8
22.Nh6 ...
A small concluding combination: the rook cannot escape, due to the threat of 23.Nf5+. In addition to the text, whereby White wins the exchange, and thus renders the remainder of the game a matter of technique, there was also 22.Qh6+, a reasonable move which maintains the attack.

5.Bd3 0-0
6.Nf3 d5

A little reshaping of a fashionable variation: instead of c6, the knight is brought to d7. For this game, Euwe makes his appearance as Theoretician: he wishes to demonstrate that by keeping both his bishops and forcing the trade of pieces, Black has an easy draw.
8.a3 dxc4
9.Bxc4 ...
If White takes the bishop (9.axb4), there is a good in-between move: 9...c5xd4 (9...cxd4), when two of White’s pieces are

. After 10.Bxc4 dxc3, neither 11.Qb3 nor the immediate 11.bxc3 gives White any noticeable advantage.

White has some advantage in development, but no place to focus his energies, since Black has no weaknesses anywhere; and there are so few pieces left... Meanwhile, Black intends to bring his bishop out to a good position on c6 via d7, or by ...b7-b6 and ...Bc8-b7.

With many pieces on the board, this push always promises action; here, it seems more like a fleeting glimpse of what might have been.

4.Bf4 Bg7
5.e3 0-0
Offering a pawn (6.cxd5 Nxd5 7.Nxd5 Qxd5 8.Bxc7) for the quick development of his queen- side; but Reshevsky prefers a quieter continuation.
6.Qb3 c5
7.cxd5 cxd4
8.exd4 e6
Having begun the game in gambit style, Szabo sees no point in half-measures, and sacrifices a second pawn. This gambit is an idea of Trifunovic’s, and is based on the fact that White has not one kingside piece developed yet. Black seeks to destroy the enemy pawn center and create threats against the king. In the present instance, however, the price paid for all this — two pawns — is too high.
9.dxe6 Nc6
10.exf7+ Kh8
11.Nf3 Nxd4

13.Be3 Qe5
You will find this diagram in the book “Grunfelda Odbrana” by Trifunovic, Gruber and Bozic (Section One, System Two, Variant # 18, Continuation A), with a note stating that Black, for his two sacrificed pawns, has two threats: ...Ng4 and ...Be6. Clearly, both sides are playing a prepared line; now we shall see how Reshevsky uses one bishop to meet both threats.
14.Be2 Be6
15.Bc4 Bd7
Szabo’s first independent move of this game, and it loses immediately. Trading bishops (15...Bxc4 16.Qxc4) in order to develop the rook to c8 (16...Rac8) with tempo would have been more in the spirit of this variation. If 17.Qb3 Ng4 18.Nd1 Rc7, and Black recovers one of his pawns; and if 17.Qd4 Qh5, when Black’s threat of ...Ng4 prevents White from castling and allows the recovery of one of Black’s pawns.
White would probably have played 17.Qf4, but then 17...Qe6 was possible, with reasonable counterplay.

Black hurriedly removes the more dangerous pawn: if 22...Qxb2 White trades queens (23.Qxb2 Bxb2) and plays 24.Rad1, and then 24...Bxa2 allows an elegant mate: 25.Rd2 Rb8 26.Rxb2 Rxb2 27.Bd4. Black would be forced to take the f-pawn off on move 24, when White would remain a healthy pawn up.

White’s passive play, his premature exchange on d5, and the unfortunately posted queen’s bishop, render any effective play against Black’s hanging pawns impracticable.

White violates one of the classic principles of the opening by thus moving the same piece twice; as a matter of fact, he is preparing to move the knight yet a third time, in order to bring it to c4. Is this the end of the principle, then? Of course not! Black, you see, has already violated classical principles twice himself, by exchanging a center pawn for a wing pawn and by giving himself a backward pawn at d6; with his last move, furthermore, he has saddled himself with weaknesses on the dark squares as well. If one side were to play concretely, however, while the other side contented himself with following the rules, the winner would not be difficult to predict..
(Let’s take an extreme case:
(to the line)
1.f3? e6 2.g4? What should Black do? Moving the queen so early in the game is not generally recommended, but in this instance, taking White’s errors into consideration, 2...Qh4 does not look bad.)
The knight maneuver from f3 via d2 to c4 in this position was played by Nimzovich in a famous game against Marshall from the New York 1927 tournament; since then, it has become popular. Its point is to generate enough pressure on the d-pawn and the square b6 to prevent Black from carrying out his only possible active plan here: ...a7-a6, ...b7-b5, etc., which, with the knight on c4, can be met with a2-a4-a5. Additionally, from d2 the knight can support the advance e2-e4: combined with f2-f4 and e4-e5, this is White’s main strategic idea in this position.

13.a4 a6
14.a5 ...
White has the better position. Black has no immediate prospects of exploiting his “extra” queen- side pawn, since the pawn at a5 restrains two of Black’s pawns. Meanwhile, White can begin the pawn roller with e4, f4 and e5 at the first available opportunity, clearing the way for the d-pawn. Gligoric, however, prefers piece maneuvers to all-out pawn assaults, so the e-pawn never even gets as far as the fourth rank.
14...Re8
15.Bf4 Qe7
16.Qb3 ...
It’s hard to win games without moving any pawns at all. One good line here would appear to be 16.Na4 Nd7 17.Rb1, followed by b2-b4, opening up the b-file with the intention of turning the d-pawn’s flank. Or he might try to induce Black’s pawn to advance to c4 and then try to win it.
16...Nd7
17.Rfe1 Ne5
18.Na4 Bd7

20.Bd2 Bb5

White still has the advantage. He intends to smoke the knight out of e5 and weaken Black’s king position by the exchange of bishops, and then play e2-e4-e5. Sensing real danger, Petrosian tries some tactics; his next two moves, ...c5-c4 and ...f7-f5, complicate his position, but do not improve it.

31.Ra5 Qb4
32.Re2 Qxc3
The weakness of Black’s a- and c-pawns, along with the concrete threat of 33.Qxb4 and Rxa6, forces him to exchange queens and take on a somewhat inferior endgame, but one in which he does have a passed pawn. The next part of the game takes place in a time- scramble, where both sides play inaccurately.
33.bxc3 Kf8
34.Kg1 ...
This move allows Black time to regroup, freeing his rook from defending the a-pawn.
34...Rb1+
35.Kf2 Bb5
36.g4 Rc1
The pawn would have been better attacked from the side with 36...Rb3 37.Rc2. Then Black could have continued the plan begun by 33...Kf8 — to bring his king to the queenside and try to put some life into his passed pawn.
37.Ra3 Kf7
Here too, 37...Rb1, intending ...Rb3, was better: Black would not have had to display so much ingenuity to get a draw.
38.Bf3 Re7
39.h4 Rd1
40.g5 Rd3
The rook stands poorly here. Black will now have to find just the right move to draw.
41.h5 ...
Here the game was adjourned. After home analysis, both players concluded that the draw was within Black’s capabilities, so Gligoric only asked to see what move Black had sealed. Petrosian, of course, was not about to allow a pawn on h6.
41...gxh5
DRAW
28. Taimanov—Najdorf
(King’s Indian)
Let the reader be forewarned: this was one of the tourney’s most interesting games, and the recipient of a brilliancy prize. Both of its phases — opening and middlegame — were conducted by Najdorf with such a high degree of erudition and mastery that the need of a third phase never arose.
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 g6
3.Nc3 Bg7
4.e4 d6
5.Nf3 0-0
6.Be2 e5
7.0-0 Nc6
8.d5 ...
Not too long before this tournament, Taimanov employed this opening variation — 7...Nc6 8.d5 — twice in the 20th USSR Championship. In both cases, he scored with one and the same plan: a pawn break on the c- file, followed by an outflanking and turning maneuver around the entire grouping of Black’s pieces on the d- through g-files, leaving only the darksquare bishop to guard his king. These games made the rounds of the chess press, and the general consensus was that they had been lost in the opening.
However, a few players still ventured this “refuted” variation of the King’s Indian; at the Mar del Plata tournament of 1953, for example, Najdorf fell victim to fashion: playing White, in this variation, he lost to Gligoric and only drew with difficulty against Trifunovic. At the start of the tournament in Zurich, however, these games were not known to Taimanov.
Thus, both sides played the opening with great expectations: Najdorf, having absorbed the Yugoslav analyses, which ran at least to move 21, and Taimanov, still flushed with his previous successes.
8...Ne7
9.Ne1 Nd7
10.Be3 f5
11.f3 f4
12.Bf2 ...
Taimanov’s kingside defensive array appears most imposing: the pawns on light squares form a kind of toothed fortress wall, with the darksquare bishop covering the gaps between the teeth. But if the position be examined without prejudgment, then it would be naive to speak of any sort of advantage to White. Could Black hope to obtain more from the opening than the development of all his pieces, the advance ...f7-f5-f4, occupation of the dark squares, and substantial attacking prospects on the kingside? Naturally, in view of the extreme sharpness of the position, Black must play exactly, combining his attack with defense of the queen’s wing, especially d6 and c7 — and seize every tactical chance.
12...g5
13.Nd3 Nf6
14.c5 Ng6
15.Rc1 Rf7

This was the system employed by Gligoric and Trifunovic at Mar del Plata. Now the d-pawn is defended, the rook can go to the g-file, and Black’s knights hover over the king’s wing. Taimanov, however, trusts the invulnerability of his position, and continues with his cavalier assault on the queenside.

What a picture! The queen’s wing is by now completely deserted, while seven pieces assail the white king; now the square g2 is attacked four times, and there is obviously nothing left to defend it with: on 34.gxh3 there follows mate in three moves, and 34...Rxf3 is threatened too.
34.Qe2 Nxg2

(Let’s take an extreme case: 1.f3? e6 2.g4? What should Black do? Moving the queen so early in the game is not generally recommended, but in this instance, taking White’s errors into consideration, 2...Qh4 does not look bad.)

White must develop the bishop anyway; so, making hay out of the fact that it would not be in Black’s best interest to interpose a piece, he induces 7...c6, shutting in Black’s bishop without loss of tempo. Black therefore ought not to have been in so much of a hurry to push his d-pawn; 5...Be7 instead was better.
7...c6
8.Bd3 Be7
9.0-0 0-0
10.b3 Nbd7

Not very logical. White quite evidently intends to bring his knight to f5, when the bishop will be forced to retreat: better to have prepared a place for it on f8 while also playing the useful move 11...Re8.
12.Nh4 Re8
13.Nf5 Bf8
14.Rc1 Ne4
Positional evaluation alone is not sufficient grounds for such a decision: deep and accurate calculation is necessary too. Feeling that his position is gradually worsening, and knowing Petrosian’s power in just such positions, Taimanov changes key, and invites his opponent to trip the light combinative. Psychologically correct, this decision is also very much in accord with Taimanov’s style.
15.Bxe4 dxe4
16.Qg4 ...
The inviting 16.d5 cxd5 17.Nxd5 would lead nowhere after the exchange of bishop for knight: 17...Bxd5 18.Qxd5 Nc5. However. 17.Nb5 was well worth a try: the threats are 18.Nc7 and 18.Nd6, and if 17...Rc8 18.Qg4. On the other hand, Black loses after 16.d5 cxd5 17.Nxd5 Nc5 18.Nh6+ gxh6 19.Nf6+, etc. Curiously, the pawn at c6, blocking the bishop’s diagonal as a result of Black’s barely noticeable opening inaccuracy, provides the basis for this combination, as well as for the one which actually occurs in the game.
16...g6
The threat was Nh6+, Nxf7+, and Nxd8.
17.Nxe4 ...
White indicates his readiness to sacrifice a piece: Black could play 17...h5, when White’s queen would have to leave either the g-file, unpinning the pawn and thereby losing the knight at f5, or the fourth rank, losing the knight at e4. Taimanov, however, feels that the risk is too great, and so he contents himself with the trade of rook and two pawns for both the knights. Material equality is maintained, and the struggle flares anew.

Petrosian wants to throw his e- and f-pawns into the attack too, but this requires one more move than the laws of chess will allow him. As Najdorf suggests, what was required was 21.Rc3 c5 22.Rg3 cxd4 23.Rd1 Ne6 24.Qg4, or 21...Qxd4 22.Ba1 Bc8 23.Qf3, with a powerful attack.

Leaving, as usual, only one bodyguard for his king, Taimanov has established all of his other pieces in their best positions.

A position which occurs so often these days that it might be worthwhile to say a few words about it here: not about systems, or variations to boggle the memory, but about the ideas which will direct the play on both sides for many moves to come.
By this exchange in the center, Black has opened his bishop’s diagonal to attack the d4 square; shortly, he will also attack the pawn at e4 with rook and knight. The knight’s position on c5 will be secured with ...a5, and this pawn may also be pushed further: to a4, and even to a3.
For the moment, White attacks nothing, but he does dispose of a strong center and freedom to maneuver. Look at the board: White’s pieces and pawns occupy four ranks, and Black’s, three, with a “no-man’s-land” between. These geometrical features largely reflect the character of the opening, as the opposing forces have not yet come into contact. White’s further plans are simple: to develop the bishop and the queen, to connect his rooks, prepare an attack on the weak pawn at d6 with which Black must eventually saddle himself in this deployment, and keep an eye on the defense of the e-pawn. The differing ways to defend this pawn lead to different systems of play. Qc2 would be a handy move, but this would leave the knight on d4
en prise
for a moment, which Black might be able to exploit; if Be3 is played first, then Black has ...Ng4. It is this sort of tempo-play, with its many combinative possibilities (due to the fact that all of the pieces and nearly all of the pawns are still on the board), that makes the King’s Indian Defense such a delight to its adherents.
9...Nc5
10.f3 ...
Before leaving for this tournament, every one of its participants prepared a few new systems, especially in the popular openings such as the King’s Indian, the Sicilian and the Nimzo-Indian. One of the best of these must be the system Averbakh introduced in the present game: f3, and Rf2-d2. White prepares an attack on the d-pawn, but practice has shown that it makes little sense to take it with the queen, since on d6 the queen itself becomes vulnerable to attack, and must quickly retreat. The enemy camp must therefore be invaded with a weaker piece first. The move 10.f3 also secures the pawn at e4, while the fianchettoed bishop’s diagonal is only closed temporarily.
10...a5
11.Be3 a4
12.Rf2 c6
13.Nc2 Qe7
14.Rd2
White’s position is solid as a rock. Now Black can only defend the d-pawn by tactical means, since 14...Rd8 obviously loses to 15.Bxc5. Gligoric proves equal to the challenge: his is not a mechanical but a creative mastery of every nuance of the King’s Indian. It’s hard to believe that ten moves hence Black still will not have had to give up his d-pawn!
14...Nfd7
15.Rc1 ...
The pawn capture (15.Rxd6) here would run into 15...a3, and if 16.Nxa3 Bxc3, winning a piece. White neutralizes this threat, and what else does Black have now?
15...Be5
This looks senseless: surely the bishop cannot stay here very long — but stay here it does.
16.Bf2 ...
If 16.f4 Bxc3 17.bxc3 Nxe4 18.Bxe4 Qxe4 19.Rxd6, Black’s kingside may be weakened, but White’s is no better off, and pawns are still even.

The position certainly is ripe for decisive action, but it might have been worth the trouble to make one more preparatory move: 23.Rbd1.
23.b4 Na6
24.f4 Bg7
25.f5 ...
The sort of move that is either very good or very bad. Its drawbacks are so obvious that the advance of this pawn to f5 is only playable when a forcing line has been calculated, resulting in a clear advantage. In the present instance, Averbakh probably assessed the position after Black’s 33rd move incorrectly.
25...Bd7
26.Qb3 ...
The tempo of the attack slackers somewhat here. A better idea might have been 26.fxg6 fxg6 27.e5 Rxe5 28.Qxg6, getting close to the black king and paralyzing Black by threats like 29.Rxd6, 29.Nf5, 29.Ne4, etc.
26...Nf6
27.fxg6 ...
But now this exchange is a mistake. It was not yet too late to play 27.Rbd1, continuing, in the event of 27...Bf8, with 28.c5.
27...fxg6
28.c5+ Be6
29.cxd6 Bxb3
30.dxc7 Bf7
A number of weaknesses have cropped up in White’s position.
31.b5 Nxc7
32.bxc6 bxc6
33.Rb7 Rac8
Averbakh may have thought a rook on the seventh would give him the better of it, but the pawn at a3 is now so dangerous that this position should probably be considered as favoring Black.
34.Rc2 ...
The threat was 34...Ng4.
34...Na6
35.Bf1 Nc5
36.Rxf7 ...
Averbakh’s resourcefulness does not abandon him, even in the most difficult situations. In time pressure, he sets a trap, but Gligoric finds the proper rebuttal.

31. Szabo—Bronstein
(
Old Indian Defense
)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 d6
3.Nf3 Nbd7
4.g3 e5
5.Bg2 c6
White’s seemingly irreproachable development turns out to have a hole in it after all: he has failed to take control of e4, and Black exploits this immediately by preparing ...e5-e4 and ...d6-d5. Szabo prefers to exchange pawns at e5, but this gives Black an easy game, and he begins at once to lay plans to assume the initiative.
6.dxe5 dxe5
7.0-0 Bc5
8.Nc3 0-0
9.Qc2 Qe7
10.Nh4 Re8
11.Na4 ...
One of those dynamic positions characteristic of contemporary chess, in which one may evaluate the possibilities for both sides, but find it difficult to determine which side has the advantage. Usually, both sides feel they stand better; occasionally, both sides think that they stand worse. In the present instance, the pivotal factor is the pawn at e5. With the support of rook and queen, it may easily advance to e3. To counteract this, White tries to disorganize the enemy ranks by carrying out flanking raids with his cavalry. Black decides not to waste time retreating the bishop, since the exchange on c5 would develop his knight to a good position and uncover his queen’s bishop as well. Black’s move also cuts off the retreat at f3 from the white king’s knight. All of these advantages are more than enough compensation for the “sacrifice” of his Indian bishop.
11...e4
12.Nf5 Qe5
13.Bh3 ...
With the unsubtle threat of 14.Bf4; but now Black succeeds in spiriting his bishop away, not only giving his queen the square a5, but also underscoring the misplaced state of the knight at a4. After 13.Nxc5 Nxc5 14.Ne3 the game would have been roughly even, while now Black has the initiative firmly in hand. Unwilling to settle for a titmouse, Szabo goes after an entire crane— and sure enough, soon one flies down for him.
13...Bf8
14.Bd2 Qc7
15.Bg2 ...
Forced: after Black carries out his threat to move his queen’s knight, an unpleasant pin would arise along the diagonal h3-c8.
15...g6
16.Ne3 Qe5
17.f4 Qh5
Another strong line was 17...exf3 18.exf3 Qd4.
18.h3 ...
In view of Black’s positional threat of ...Nf8 and ...Bh3, etc., White is practically forced to sacrifice his e-pawn.
18...Qxe2
With this, Black’s queen sets out on a long and hazardous journey. Five queen moves for a single pawn: even the arithmetical balance is clearly unfavorable to Black. Still, what can White accomplish with those five moves?
19.Rad1 Qd3
20.Qc1 Qd6
21.g4 Qc7
So, White has made just one useful move: 19.Rad1; and as for those kingside pawn moves, those might better be called double-edged than favorable to White.
To which we might add that Black could have made still better use of his pieces, with 19...Nc5 20.Nc3, and now 20...Qd3. In that event Black’s knight would stand actively on c5, the queen’s bishop would have been uncovered, and White’s bishop would have been temporarily deprived of the c3 square.
What conclusion may we draw from all of this? That when one is well developed, one can afford to spend a few moves to capture an important enemy pawn; but bear in mind that one must also evaluate the position correctly, and calculate accurately...
22.Bc3 ...
22...Bg7
Black breaks both of the rules laid down in the previous note, in his distracted determination to exploit the position of the white knight on a4. The obvious 22...b5 would have forced White to trade off his best piece, the bishop on c3. But 23.Bxf6 Nxf6 24.cxb5 Qa5 didn’t seem clear enough to me, so I decided to make some sort of waiting move. Now Black also threatens ...b5, but —
23.g5 b5
Alas! Black must give up the knight, in order to avoid getting mated: 23...Nh5 24.Bxg7 Nxg7 25.Ng4, followed by 26.Qc3, and White is master of the diagonal a1-h8. Knowing Szabo’s skill with a direct attack, I had no illusions as to the outcome, were I to enter that line. Now Black fights on with the energy of despair.
24.gxf6 Bf8
The bishop returns, Shorn of honor, For his steed has fallen By the road...
25.cxb5 cxb5
26.Nd5 Qc6
27.f5 ...
The idea behind this pawn move appears in the variation 27...bxa4 28.fxg6 hxg6 29.Ne7+ Bxe7 30.fxe7 Rxe7 31.Qh6 Ne5 32.Rd8+ Re8 33.Bxe5! That also explains Black’s reply: by connecting his rooks, he protects the eighth rank.
27...Bb7
28.fxg6 hxg6
29.Ne7+ Bxe7
30.fxe7 b4
In order to distract that awful bishop from the long diagonal, if only for a moment.
31.Bxb4 ...
31.Qf4 wasn’t bad, either.
31...Qxa4
32.Bc3 ...
Szabo is dead set on a checkmate. Also quite sufficient to win was 32.Ba3, holding on to the e-pawn.
32...Rxe7
33.Qh6 ...
A bit of tactics: White draws the knight to e5 in order to set up the following fork. Strangely enough, however, this move gives Black defensive chances, since the diagonal a1-h8 is briefly closed. 33.Qg5 Rae8 34.Rxd7 and 35.Qf6 was stronger.
33...Ne5
34.Qg5 Qe8
Black is now so terrorized by the bishop on c3 that all he can think about any more is how soon he can play ...Ra8-c8xc3. I played 34...Qe8 without thinking, but here was the place to try 34...Rae8, answering Euwe’s recommendation of 35.Rd8 simply by 35...Re6, continuing to balance somehow on cliff’s edge.
35.Rf4 Rc8
36.Rh4 ...
36...Rxc3
For the first time since move 23, I breathed a sigh of relief— only to notice 37.Qf6!, and mate next move...
37.Qh6 f6
38.bxc3 Rg7
Up to this point, Black was battling the bishop on c3; now he continues the fight with its ghost. 38...Kf7 was correct, although White would still have retained sufficient advantage to win.
39.Rd8 Qxd8
40.Qh8+ Kf7
41.Qxd8 g5
42.Rh6
After checking the scoresheet to make sure that no one had forfeited,
BLACK RESIGNED
32. Euwe—Reshevsky
(
Nimzoindian Defense

1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6
3.Nc3 Bb4
4.e3 c5
5.Bd3 0-0
6.a3 Bxc3+
7.bxc3 b6
Perhaps an appropriate continuation with a different move- order — for instance, that which occurred in Game 9, Geller-Euwe, where Bd3 had not yet been played and Black had not yet castled. There, White had to expend a move on f2-f3, whereas here he could play 8.e4, easily carrying out an advance that would ordinarily have cost him a good deal of trouble. It is amazing that Reshevsky, who is such an expert on the Black side of the Samisch line, should have allowed such a possibility, and also that Euwe should not have exploited it. After 8.e4, 9.Bg5 is threatened, and if Black’s knight retreats to e8 (8...Ne8), then 9.Qh5! begins White’s attack before castling.
The reader will find just such a development of events in Game 77, when Reshevsky ventured a repeat of this variation against Keres.
8.Ne2 Bb7
9.0-0 d6
10.Qc2 d5
One might assume Reshevsky had forgotten that pawns may also move two squares! However, the gradual advance of this pawn has its logic too. With White playing slowly (10.Ng3! was best), Reshevsky amends his error on move 7, stopping White’s e3-e4 for some time to come. After 10.Ng3, 10...d5 could have been met by 11.cxd5 exd5 12.Nf5, so the correct reply would have been 10...Nc6. But now, Black answers the exchange of central pawns by a clever maneuver which is only possible with the queen at c2.
11.cxd5 Qxd5
Black threatens mate at g2, no more and no less. The natural 12.f3 allows 12...c4; that leaves White only 12.Nf4, when the knight will not be very well placed. Thus, the mate threat wasn’t so naive after all: it led to a substantive change in the position which was definitely not in White’s favor.
12.Nf4 Qc6
13.c4 cxd4
13...g5 would be bad, of course: after 14.d5 Black’s position crumbles.
14.exd4 Nbd7

16.Rfe1 Rac8
17.Rac1 Nf8
18.Bf1 ...
The changing of the guard.
18...Ng6
19.Nxg6 ...
The only possible explanation for this exchange must be that Euwe wanted to try to mate Black on the opened h-file. 19.Nd3 would have been much better, maintaining the option of driving out Black’s queen with either Ne5 or Nb4, thus freeing the bishop at f1 for work along its proper diagonal: b1-h7.
19...hxg6
20.Re3 Red8
21.Qe2 Qd6
22.Rh3 ...
It seems our guess was correct.
22...Qf4
23.Rd1 Ba6
24.Rf3 Qe4
25.Re3 Qg4
26.f3 ...
Reshevsky’s skillful queen maneuvers have induced first one weakening, then another. White does not want to trade queens, fearing to go into an endgame with his hanging pawns.
26...Qf4
27.g3 Qh6
28.Rc3 Qg5
29.Qf2 Rd7
30.Rdc1 ...
White absolutely must bring his bishop out via c1 to f4, and then to e5. Now was the time: 30.Bc1 Qa5 31.Qb2 Rdd8 32.Bf4, and 32...Nd5 doesn’t work, while 32...Rc7 is now rendered impossible.
30...Rdc7
31.R1c2 Qa5
32.Bc1 ...
But this is very much the wrong time: 32.Rc1 was the proper continuation of his defense, although White’s game is, by and large, already ruined. Black would have brought up his knight via e8 to d6, continuing the assault on White’s hanging pawns.
32...Nd5
No doubt Euwe overlooked this decisive stroke.

33. Stahlberg—Keres
(Queen’s Gambit)
The reader has certainly noticed by this time, and will probably continue to note, that we avoid detailed examination of opening variations. When two armies march to the battlefield, there are so many roads they can take that one could never describe all of them.
In the present game, however, we shall make an exception, since Keres employs a defense that is not found in the opening books.
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6
3.Nf3 d5
4.Nc3 c5
5.cxd5 cxd4
Theory examines only 5...Nxd5, and considers that White gets a small advantage with the continuation 6.e3 Nc6 7.Bc4. Keres
’
move has never been seen in major tournaments, and must have been something Keres whipped up himself, especially for this tournament. Is it any good? Apparently, no worse than anything else; at any rate, Keres used it three times, and the 2½ points it brought him speak for themselves.
6.Qxd4 ...
White has gained the time to develop his queen, but Black wins it back shortly with 8...Nc6. There would have been no point in sacrificing a piece for three pawns by 6.dxe6 dxc3 7.exf7+ Ke7 8.Qxd8+ Kxd8 9.bxc3, since the pawn on f7 will fall sooner or later.
6...exd5
7.Bg5 ...
In later games (Nos. 155 and 210), Najdorf and Geller played 7.e4 against Keres, but they came prepared. In his first encounter with an unfamiliar variation, Stahlberg could not risk a sharp continuation.
7...Be7
8.e3 Nc6
9.Qd2 0-0
10.Be2 Be6
11.0-0 Ne4
This freeing possibility is an important link in this system, and doubtless Keres had foreseen it. If now 12.Bxe7 Qxe7 13.Nxd5?, then 13...Qd7, winning a piece.
12.Nxe4 dxe4
13.Bxe7 ...
Danger still stalks White: 13.Qxd8 Bxd8, and once again, White comes out a piece down.
13...Qxe7
14.Nd4 Rfd8
A final snare: if 15.Nxc6, then 15...Rxd2 16.Nxe7+ Kf8, and Black recovers his piece with the superior position.
15.Rfd1 Nxd4
16.exd4 Rd6
Keres’ new system has successfully withstood its baptism of fire. The game’s further course revolves around the pawn at d4. It is isolated, but also passed; Black would like to capture it, but he must blockade it first.
17.Qe3 Bd5
18.Rac1 Rad8
19.Bc4 h6
20.h3 a6

27.Rf1 Rd2
28.Ra8 Rxa8
29.Qxa8+ Kh7
30.Qf3 g6
Black has a small but clear positional advantage, which may be explained, but is hard to put into any sort of concrete form. The black king is better sheltered from possible checks, with the pawn at f5 rendering special service in this regard by protecting against diagonal checks. (A similar disadvantage nearly cost Keres his Round 29 game against Taimanov.) In the present case, however, the white pieces are solidly placed, and the last move, 30...g6, which laid bare the seventh rank, certainly did not increase Black’s winning chances.
31.Re1 Rxb2
32.Qa3 ...
Now White has some threats of his own.
32...Qd4+
33.Kh1 h5
34.Qe7+ ...
White could easily have played 34.Qf8, too: Black would then have had nothing but to play 34...Re2, when 35.Rxe2 Qd1+ 36.Kh2 Qxe2 37.Qf7+ Kh6 38.h4 probably leads to a draw.
34...Kh6
35.Qf8+ ...
Here and two moves later White misses a simple draw: 35.h4, with the threat 36.Qg5+ and 37.Qe7+.
35...Kg5
36.Qe7+ Kh6
37.Qf8+ Qg7
38.Qc5 ...
With queens off, the rook ending would be a loss for White.
38...Qf6
39.a3 Rb3
40.Rd1 f4
41.Rf1 f3
42.Rxf3 Rxf3
43.gxf3 Qxf3+
44.Kh2 ...
It is possible to draw queen endings with very accurate play. Keres intends to set up a position in which White will not be able to avoid the exchange of queens. For this purpose, the king must be brought to the queen’s wing. The winning method is interesting, and a useful bit of knowledge to have, but its execution in this game was abetted by an inaccuracy from White.
44...h4 45.Qe5 Qf2+ 46.Kh1 Qf5 47.Qh8+ Kg5 48.Qd8+ Kf4 49.Qd2+ Kf3 50.Qd1+ Ke3 51.Qe1+ Kd3 52.Qb1+ Ke2 53.Qb2+ Ke3 54.Qc1+ Ke4 55.Qb1+ Kf3 56.Qd1+ Kf4 57.Qd2+
An error that helps Black set up the winning position. 57.Qc1+ was correct, so as to meet 57...Ke5 with 58.Qc5+, keeping the king out of the queenside.
57...Ke5 58.Qc3+ Kd5 59.Qb3+ Kc6 60.Qc3+ Kb7 61.Qg7+ Ka6 62.Qc3 Qf1+ 63.Kh2 Qf2+ 64.Kh1 Kb6 65.Qc8 Qe1+ 66.Kg2 Qe4+ 67.Kg1 Qd4+
WHITE RESIGNED
— since Black now has every point on the c-file from c7 to c4 to support an exchange of queens. After 68.Kg2 Qd5+ 69.Kh2 Qd6+ forces the trade.
34. Boleslavsky—Smyslov
(Queen’s Gambit)
1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 dxc4 5.a4 Bf5 6.e3 e6 7.Bxc4 Bb4
A defensive system prepared by Smyslov for the Zurich event. Although he used it four times, drawing all four games in short order, I still consider this a difficult variation for Black. Smyslov had to display a great deal of resourcefulness in order to equalize, and his opponents did not always exploit their opportunities to the fullest. After this tournament, neither Smyslov nor the other masters made much further use of this defense, so it has disappeared from practice.
8.0-0 Nbd7 9.Qe2 0-0 10.e4 Bg6 11.e5 Nd5 12.Nxd5 cxd5 13.Bd3 a6 14.Bxg6 fxg6 15.Be3 Qe7 16.Rfc1 Rfc8 17.Bd2 h6

A theoretical novelty, introduced in this game, which received further development in the USSR Championships, and was finally found not quite satisfactory for Black. In this game, Kotov avoids risk by quick simplification.

ROUND SIX
36. Smyslov—Kotov
(
Sicilian Defense
)
1.e4 c5
2.Nf3 d6
3.d4 cxd4
4.Nxd4 Nf6
5.Nc3 a6
6.Be2 e5
The outcome of a game between Smyslov and Kotov may be hard to predict, but there can never be any doubt about what the opening will be: Smyslov feels honor- bound to play 1.e4, and Kotov invariably replies 1...c5.
This time, Kotov alters the tradition a bit: instead of his usual Scheveningen, in which ...e5 is played only at the last minute, with White’s threats already hanging overhead, he tips his hat to fashion and plays ...e5 on move six. One idea behind this rather eccentric move is that here 7.Nf5 is unfavorable, due to the reply 7...Bxf5 and 8...d5.
7.Nb3 Be7
8.Be3 Nbd7
9.0-0 0-0
10.f3 Qc7
11.Qe1 ...
Smyslov’s omission of a2-a4 on this or the preceding move allows Black too much leeway. Had Black played 10...b5, White still might have replied 11.a4 b4 12.Nd5 Nxd5 and retaken with the queen; but now ...b5 is wholly unobjectionable. All that White has gotten out of the opening is safe and solid control of e4. That’s something — we shall have numerous occasions to remember it during the course of the game — but still one might have hoped for more.
11...b5
12.a3 Nb6
13.Qf2 Rb8
14.Rab1 ...
14...Nc4 and 14...Na4 were both threatened. That White should be forced to make such a move as 14.Rab1 indicates that there is something disharmonious in his position.
14...Be6
15.Kh1 Nc4
This has its logic, but 15...d5 looks far more attractive, demonstrating as it does that the pawn on d6 wasn’t really weak at all. It gives Black more than just the moral victory of proving that he could bring more force to bear on d5 than White: it would have given Black a free game for his pieces as well (15...d5 16.exd5 Nbxd5 17.Nxd5 Nxd5 18.Bc5 Nf4).
16.Bxc4 bxc4
17.Nc1 Rb7
Smyslov comes up with an excellent antidote to this straightforward plan of doubling rooks and winning the b-pawn; here too, 17...d5 was good with the same ideas as noted before.
18.N1a2 d5
At the most inappropriate moment. 18...a5 was now necessary; only after 19.a4 Qb8 20.Nb5 would 20...d5 be possible.
19.exd5 Bxd5
20.Nb4 Bxb4
21.axb4 ...
21...Qc6
22.Bg5 ...
Exploiting the fact that the bishop is tied up temporarily, White begins a kingside attack. 22...Rxb4 23.Bxf6 gxf6 24.Qd2 Be6 25.Ne4 is bad for Black, so the rook beats a disappointed retreat from b7.
22...Rd7
23.Rfe1 Re8
24.Rbd1 ...
Smyslov plays simply and directly; gradually, his pieces assume better and better positions. Now 25.Bxf6 is a threat.
24...Nh5
25.Qh4 g6
26.Nxd5 Rxd5
27.Rxd5 Qxd5
28.Qe4 ...
Now that White has induced ...g6, one might expect him to attack this weakening; but instead, judging correctly that Black’s castled position would prove very difficult to penetrate, Smyslov suggests a transition into an endgame that is slightly better for him, based on his control of the square e4.
28...Qxe4
Kotov agrees, mistakenly, to the trade of queens: the weak pawns at a6 and c4 leave him little chance to save the endgame. With queens still on, Black might eventually get a chance to play ...f5 and ...e4.
29.Rxe4 f6
30.Be3 Rc8
31.g4 Ng7
32.g5 ...
32.Bc5 would not have won a pawn in view of 32...a5 33.Rxc4 axb4, and the pawn cannot be taken, either by rook or bishop; if then 34.b3 Ne6 35.Bxb4 Rxc4 36.bxc4 Nd4, and this endgame is most probably a draw.
However, White has found a way to exploit the weakness at e5.
32...Kf7
33.gxf6 Kxf6
34.Bd2 Nf5
35.Bc3 Nd4
36.f4 ...
Nothing would come of 36.Bxd4 exd4 37.Rxd4 c3 38.b3 Re8: the rook invades the second rank and wins the c-pawn, which draws. Now Kotov wins the c-pawn at once, but his knight gets driven to a1, and Black’s position becomes critical.
36...Nxc2
37.Re2 Na1
38.Rxe5 ...
Smyslov’s fine play has brought the game to this winning position, but now time-pressure puts him on the wrong path. 38.fxe5+ Ke6 39.Rf2 would have led to swift victory for White — or perhaps 38.Kg2 first, and only then 39.fxe5+, would have been yet more thematic. Smyslov’s plan appears powerful, but leaves Black a hidden drawing resource.
38...Kf7
39.Ra5 Nc2
40.Rxa6 Rb8
41.Rc6 Nxb4
42.Rc7+ ...
An essential check: if 42.Rxc4 is played at once, then 42...Nd5 43.Be5 Rb3, and Black’s king goes to f5 via e6. Now, after 42...Ke6 43.Rxc4, 43...Nd5 is no longer possible, because of 44.Re4+, when 44...Kf5 loses the knight, and 44...Kd6 allows 45.Be5+. Even after this check, however, the draw is still there, with
42...Ke6
43.Rxc4 Nd3
44.b4 Rf8
DRAW
37. Keres—Boleslavsky
(
Old Indian Defense
)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 d6
3.Nc3 e5
A radical means of avoiding both the Samisch and the Four Pawns’ Attack. Whatever White plays, the pure Samisch setup is now unattainable: for example, after 4.d5, Black is by no means obliged to fianchetto his bishop, but may play instead 4...Bf5, and if 5.f3 e4.
If 4.e4, Black gains a tempo for development with 4...exd4 5.Qxd4 Nc6, after which he may play either 6...Be7 or 6...g6. And on 4.dxe5 dxe5 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8, Black’s king forfeits castling, but will find shelter at c7.
However, White still has ways of exploiting Black’s early e-pawn push, and the one Keres has in mind is 5.Bg5, a rarely-played line which is nevertheless one of White’s most solid positional ideas.
4.Nf3 Nbd7
5.Bg5 ...
If Black’s 2...d6 and 3...e5 prevented the strongest of the anti-King’s Indian attacks, then White, in turn, prevents Black from obtaining the modern form of the King’s Indian (with a fianchettoed king’s bishop), since 5...g6 6.dxe5 dxe5 7.Nxe5 costs a pawn. Black, of course, could play 5...Be7, but that sort of development for this bishop grates on a King’s Indian player. In that case, White would have a simple program: 6.e3, 7.Be2 and 8.0-0 with no fear of ...e5-e4, since his queen’s bishop is already outside his pawn chain.
Boleslavsky, who has worked steadily and with immense success at improving the King’s Indian for Black, feels himself morally obligated to correct extant opinions;- for this game, he has prepared a dizzying new line involving the sacrifice of his queen’s rook.
5...h6
6.Bh4 g5
7.dxe5 ...
If the bishop retreats again, the e-pawn rushes to the third rank, with the well-known idea of retarding White’s kingside development: 7.Bg3 e4 8.Nd2 e3’; but now we enter Boleslavsky’s main line.
7...gxh4
8.exf6 Qxf6
9.Nd5 Qxb2
Some pieces in the King’s Indian appear on a “special price” list: the darksquare bishops are at the top of that list. This means that Black has achieved something, in removing White’s bishop while retaining his own, even at the cost of shattering his own pawns. With his last move, Black initiates his previously prepared sharp attacking line, sacrificing a rook for the attack.
The attack will be based on the fact that the centralized knight is out of play at a8; the whole question is whether Black can work up decisive threats in the short time it will take White to develop his bishop and get his knight back to the center.
Boleslavsky had mainly considered the following line, in which his darksquare bishop plays the lead: 10.Nxc7+ Kd8 11.Nxa8 d5! 12.Rc1 Bb4+ 13.Nd2 Nc5 14.Rc2 Qe5 15.e3 Bf5. Najdorf’s recommendation, returning the queen to d8, is not appealing. His variation: 9...Qd8 10.Qd4 Ne5 11.Nxe5 Bg7 12.Nxf7 Kxf7 13.Qf4+ Kg8 14.0-0-0 c6 15.Nc3 Qa5, only appears playable; in actuality, Black’s one threat, 16...Bxc3, is no threat at all, and White can cheerfully take on d6 with his queen, one possible continuation being: 16.Qxd6 Bxc3 17.bxc3 Qxc3+ 18.Kb1 Bf5+ 19.e4 Bxe4+ 20.Bd3.
10.Rb1 ...
The simple move which Boleslavsky overlooked in his preparatory analysis. After 10.Nxc7+ Kd8, the move 11.Rb1 would be no problem for Black, since he would have the check on c3; here, however, with the knight on d5, the check is impossible, and Black’s whole attack is refuted.
10...Qxa2
11.Nxc7+ Kd8
12.Nxa8 Nc5
Blushing furiously at his mistake, Boleslavsky commits another. True, 12...d5 would have been useless now without the check on b4, but 12...Bg7 would still have kept up some semblance of an attack: for example, 13.Rc1 Qa3 14.Qd2 Nc5. If Black can pick up the knight on a8, he will have a pawn for the exchange. Now, however, Keres can force the exchange of queens with a series of precise moves, and all danger is liquidated.

Queen’s Gambit
)
1.d4 d5
2.c4 e6
3.Nc3 c5
4.cxd5 exd5
5.Nf3 Nc6
6.g3 c4
The Swedish Variation, a great favorite of Stahlberg and Stoltz. Black’s further plans are to diminish the pressure on the d5-pawn with ...Bb4, and to strengthen its defense with ...Ne7, avoiding the pin with Bg5 that would be possible after ...Nf6. However, 6...c4 gives the d4-pawn great additional strength: after e2-e4, it will become passed, and tie down some black pieces. The black pawn at c4 cannot be considered its equal by any stretch of the imagination, since it is not passed, and is hardly likely ever to attain that status.
7.Bg2 Bb4
8.0-0 Nge7
9.e4 dxe4
10.Nxe4 0-0
11.Qc2 ...
A Reshevsky novelty: 11.a3 Ba5 12.Qa4 was usual here, but then comes 12...Bg4, indirectly attacking, and then capturing, the d-pawn in return for his c-pawn. The point of 11.Qc2 is not the sacrifice of a pawn, of course: that’s so obviously bad for Black as to render it a mere footnote (11...Nxd4 12.Nxd4 Qxd4 13.Rd1 Qe5 14.Bf4, and White recovers the pawn with a colossal lead in development); the idea is that White can use his attack on the c-pawn to gain a tempo to bring his rook to d1. With the support of the rook, that pawn gets very lively indeed, and runs quickly down to the seventh rank, setting up dangerous tactical possibilities.
11...Qd5
12.Be3 ...
Giving his opponent the opportunity to play his bishop to f5 (12...Bf5), when there would follow 13.Nh4 Nxd4 14.Bxd4 Qxd4 15.Nxf5 Nxf5 16.Rfd1 Qe5 17.Rd5 Qxd5 18.Nf6+; or 16...Qb6 17.a3 Ba5 18.Qxc4, and the white pieces would be much more harmoniously placed than the black: 19.b4 is a threat, to which capturing on b2 (18...Qxb2) is no adequate defense, in view of 19.Qd5, forking bishop and knight.
12...Ng6
13.Nh4 Qb5
14.Nxg6 hxg6
15.a3 Be7
16.d5 Na5
17.d6 ...
Playing forcefully and concretely, Reshevsky allows his opponent not a single free breath; Black is continually forced to ward off direct threats. The game is vintage Reshevsky, and without doubt one of the tourney’s best.
17...Bd8
18.Nc3 Qa6
19.Rad1 Bg4
20.Rd4 Bf5
21.Qa4 Rb8
With the obvious intention of getting a little air by means of 22...b5, but White does not allow this either.
22.Rd5 Be6
23.Re5! b6
The pawn at d6 is loose, and the rook may be attacked four different ways — every one of which would lose material for Black. Stahlberg contents himself with the modest 23...b6, defending the knight and allowing the queen to get back to c8.
I would not have been able to resist 24.Rxe6, with Black’s queen and knight so far away from their king, his pawns weak, and the pair of white bishops sweeping the board. Variations would have to be calculated too, naturally, but I don’t believe they’d look too bad. I would recommend that the reader examine 25.Nb5, as well as 25.Qc2 and 25.Bh3, for himself.
24.d7 ...
Reshevsky’s actual move is also strong, and partly the product of time-pressure. Having no time left for calculations, Reshevsky preferred to convert the game into a technical exercise, in which there could be no doubt as to his advantage.
24...b5 25.Rxb5 Rxb5 26.Qxb5 Qxb5 27.Nxb5 a6 28.Nc3 Bxd7 29.Rd1 Bc8
White’s pieces are beautifully developed, while Black’s pawns are weak, and must fall before the marauding bishops and rook.
30.Ne4 Be7 31.Bc5 Bxc5 32.Nxc5 Bf5
An admission of helplessness, or simple oversight? Most likely, the latter.
33.Nxa6 Re8 34.Bf3 Nb3 35.Kg2 Bc2 36.Rd7 Bf5 37.Rd1 Bc2 38.Rd7 Bf5 39.Rd6 Be6 40.Nc7 Re7 41.Nxe6
BLACK RESIGNED
39. Bronstein—Euwe
(Nimzoindian Defense)
Generally, it makes sense to sacrifice a pawn, sometimes even a piece, in order to keep the enemy king in the center and assail it with rooks and queen. However, two general classes of such attacks must be distinguished: in the first category, the king is kept to the eighth rank, hemmed in by its own pawns and pieces; while in the second category, the king is driven out to the sixth rank — sometimes even to the fifth — and attempts to find shelter on one wing or the other.
The present game is an example of the latter type. The defender’s chief resource is a cool head, and my opponent made full use of his here. At one point, I had to break off my calculations in order to ask myself: Just who is attacking whom here?
During the game, and afterwards as well, I was unable to shake the feeling that somewhere I had had a win. Perhaps some concrete variation did flicker momentarily through my mind, but it tarried not... In any event, neither I, nor the commentators (Euwe, Najdorf and Stahlberg) have been able to find an improvement for White, which would mean that my promising piece sacrifice was not enough for a win. Perhaps the win may yet be found in analysis; but even if I did not get the point, I did get a lively and interesting game.
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6
3.Nc3 Bb4
4.e3 c5
5.Bd3 d5
6.Nf3 0-0
7.0-0 Nc6
8.a3 Bxc3
9.bxc3 dxc4
10.Bxc4 Qc7
All of these opening moves were played almost automatically by both sides. Now White begins preparations for e3-e4.
11.Bd3 e5
12.Qc2 Re8
This, to me, seems stronger than 12...Qe7, as Euwe played in Game 176 against Averbakh, and later in the 11th Olympiad against Botvinnik. Comparing the two continuations: 12...Qe7 13.dxe5 Nxe5 14.Nxe5 Qxe5, and 12...Re8 13.dxe5 Nxe5 14.Nxe5 Qxe5 — Black has an extra tempo in the latter line. Of course, Black temporarily prevents 13.e4 with his 12...Qe7, but is that move really so dangerous?
13.e4 exd4
Euwe could have forced the trade of queens here, with considerably simpler play after 13...c4 14.Bxc4 exd4 15.cxd4 Na5 16.Bd3 Qxc2 17.Bxc2 Nxe4; but instead, he accepts the challenge to play a more complex game, full of interesting combinations.
14.cxd4 Bg4
14...cxd4 would have been met by 15.e5. Euwe wants White to try 15.e5 Bxf3 16.exf6 Nxd4 17.Bxh7+ Kh8 18.fxg7+ Kxg7 19.Bb2 Rad8, considering his position capable of withstanding the attack. After the game, the complications were found to favor White, but I was drawn to another, more intriguing possibility.
15.Qxc5 Nxe4
16.Bxe4 Rxe4
17.Ng5 ...
Beginning an attack on the king (of course not 17.d5? Bxf3 18.gxf3 Rh4 19.f4 Qd7). Black could capture the d-pawn here, but he refrained, fearing 17...Rxd4 18.Bb2 Rd7 19.Qc2 g6 20.Ne4. I was a little uncertain about 17...Rxd4 18.Bb2 Qf4, but this exchange sacrifice didn’t look convincing enough to my opponent.
17...Re7
18.Qc2 g6
19.Ne4 Bf5
Both sides have played into this line, which involves the sacrifice of a piece. Black weakened the long diagonal by playing 18...g6 instead of the more natural 18...f5, because he wanted the f5 square kept free for his bishop; and White is giving up the piece in order to get the black king out to f6 and e6, and then assail him with all his pieces. The battle waxes uncommonly fierce.
20.Nf6+ Kg7
21.Qd2 ...
At this moment, I was quite pleased with my position. Indeed, after
21...Kxf6
Black’s king can never get back to g7, but must remain in the center, assailed by both rooks, queen, bishop and perhaps even by pawns. However, my opponent’s face showed no sign of despair either — an object lesson for the young player who finds himself in difficulties (especially when facing a mating attack), and chokes up at once, thereby rendering his defensive task still more difficult.
22.d5 ...
Here I examined 22.Bb2 and 22.Qh6 too. The text is stronger: it retains both those threats while creating a third: 23.d6.
22...Rd8
A remarkable move: Black brings up the last of his defensive reserves, and obviates all three of White’s threats at a stroke. 23.Qh6 would now be met by the calm 23...Rxd5, and on 23.Bb2+, Black plans to return the piece. Even here, I was quite optimistic still, feeling that with material equality restored White’s attack would be all the stronger.
23.Bb2+ Ne5
24.f4 ...
24.Rad1 was worth a look, but I could not see anything forcing and decided not to take any unnecessary risk.
24...Qc5+
25.Kh1 ...
Since the d-pawn is doomed anyhow, there’s no sense in putting the bishop
en prise
as well: after 25.Bd4, Euwe would have continued 25...Rxd5 26.Bxc5 Rxd2 27.Bxe7+ Kxe7 28.fxe5 Be4, which draws; or 26.fxe5+ Ke6 27.Bxc5 Rxd2 28.Bxe7 Kxe7, and Black can still draw, even though he is the exchange down.
25...Rxd5
26.fxe5+ Ke6
Having recovered his piece, White now attacks the exposed king; however, he encounters strategical difficulties in developing his attack. The king is surrounded by its own pieces, which display a sharp tendency to counterattack at the first available opportunity. The king also has many more open squares about him than would be the case if White were attacking the castled position. And finally, with White’s king tucked away at h1, his own first rank has become weak.
Nonetheless, White still has one strong trump: the opposite-colored bishops, which normally ensure an advantage to the attacking side. It may have been this chance that White failed fully to exploit.
27.Qg5 Kd7
Black would find himself ensnared after 27...Qc2 28.Rac1, since he is not really threatening the bishop: 28...Qxb2? 29.Qf6+ and 30.e6+.
28.Rac1 ...
28.a4, to exploit his strategic advantage (the darksquare bishop) would have been stronger, and possibly decisive: his opponent would have had to oppose his rook. After 28.a4, Black would be practically forced to give up the exchange; he would get a second pawn for it, but then the attack of the queen and two rooks would have become fierce indeed: for example, 28.a4 Re6 29.Ba3 Qc4 30.Bd6 Rexd6 31.exd6 Rxd6 32.Rad1; or 28...Rexe5 29.Bxe5 Rxe5 30.Rac1.
28...Qb6
29.Bc3 Re8
30.Bb4 Rexe5
To compare this with the 28.a4 line: White has brought his bishop to the strong diagonal here too, but he has given up the e-pawn for nothing. Now he could try 31.Rxf5 gxf5 32.Qg8, but after 32...Qc6!, this leads to a perpetual.
31.Qh4 a5
At this point I began to suspect that Black had started to play for the win. Having determined that 32.Qxh7 axb4 33.Qxf7+ was simply bad for me, I decided on one last attacking try: to bring the bishop via e1 to g3, creating a threat to c7.
32.Be1 h5
33.Bf2 Qa6
34.Bg3 Re4
One last detail, to complete the picture: neither side had more than two minutes left until flag- fall. 35.Qg5 Ke6 looked worse than unclear, so I decided to stop tempting fate.
35.Rxf5 ...
All of the commentators gave this move an exclamation mark, since it was by now White’s only means of forcing a draw. Nevertheless, I feel bound to admit to the reader that I sacrificed more from inspiration than from calculation. 35...gxf5 36.Rc7+ Ke8 37.Rc8+ appeared to me to be very dangerous for Black, for instance: 37...Kd7 38.Qd8+ Ke6 39.Qe8+ Kf6 40.Qh8+ Ke6 41.Re8+ Kd7 42.Rd8+ Kc6 43.Qh6+ Re6 44.Qc1+ Rc5 45.Rc8+ Kd7 46.Rxc5. Later it was shown that not all of Black’s moves in this line were forced, and that with exact play he could draw.
Had Euwe taken the rook, there would have been no practical reason why he should lose, since this variation would lie, for the most part, beyond the time control; however, he chose the more natural continuation.
35...Rxh4
For a moment, I forgot that Black’s queen had moved to a6, attacking the square f1, and very nearly went in for 36.Rxd5+ Ke6 37.Re5+?? Kf6 38.Rf1+. Do not imagine, dear reader, that the grandmasters are spotless creatures; they too, get into time- trouble; sometimes they fail to calculate a variation completely; and occasionally, they even blunder...
36.Rxd5+ Ke6
37.Rcd1 Qc4
38.Rd6+ Ke7
39.Rd7+ Kf6
39...Kf8 looked too risky: 40.Rd8+ Kg7 41.Be5+ f6 42.R8d7+ Kh6 43.Bxf6, threatening 44.Bg7+; but 43...Rf4 would stop everything.
40.Bxh4+ Qxh4
41.Rf1+ ...
The game was adjourned here, and Black sealed
41...Kg5
but there was no further play, since after 42.Rd5+ and 43.Rxa5 the
DRAW
is obvious.
40. Gligoric—Szabo
(Ruy Lopez)
The prime consideration in one’s choice of an opening plan should be the harmonious development of the pieces, but sometimes we forget about the development of the queen. Since the queen is, after all, the most important and the most valuable of the pieces, the success of the whole piece configuration may depend on how well the queen plays its part.
In some openings, the move ...c5 is important not only as a means of attacking the enemy pawn center, but also in order to give the queen an exit to c7, b6 or a5. This applies especially to systems in which the bishop is developed to e7, thus blocking the queen’s other diagonal: for example, the Orthodox Queen’s Gambit, the Chigorin Ruy Lopez, or the Classical Variation of the French Defense.
In the game Gligoric - Szabo, the development of Black’s queen became the central theme of the opening and middlegame struggle: White maintained a clear advantage as long as the queen was relegated to the eighth rank, and found his game sliding downhill as soon as the queen obtained some
lebensraum
.
1.e4 e5
2.Nf3 Nc6
3.Bb5 a6
4.Ba4 Nf6
5.0-0 Nxe4
6.d4 b5
7.Bb3 d5
8.dxe5 Be6
9.c3 ...
Here the Open Defense to the Ruy branches off into two main lines: 9...Be7 and 9...Bc5. To me, the latter seems more natural (cf. Game 70, Averbakh – Szabo), since the bishop is more actively posted, and the queen retains the option of developing on the d8-h4 diagonal.
9...Be7
10.Be3 Nc5
Szabo departs from the theoretical continuation 10...0-0 11.Nbd2 Bg4 12.Nxe4 dxe4 13.Qd5 Qxd5 14.Bxd5 exf3 15.Bxc6 fxg2 16.Rfe1, which would leave White with much the freer game.
11.Bc2 Bg4
12.Nbd2 Ne6
Black cannot take the pawn (12...Nxe5) because of the continuation 13.Bxc5 Bxc5 14.Qe1, winning a piece (13...Nxf3+ 14.gxf3 Bh3 15.Re1 is no improvement). So he retreats the knight first. Now the e- pawn is really threatened; but Gligoric proceeds to refute Black’s entire opening configuration by means of a pretty and original queen maneuver, unpinning his knight and preventing Black from castling.
13.Qb1 ...
13...Bh5
14.a4 b4
Thus, Black has developed all of his minor pieces well, holds the advanced e-pawn under observation, and could now play 14...Bg6 and castle without giving himself any pawn weaknesses. But there is one significant piece weakness in his position, and that is the queen, which is not developed, and has no good prospect of ever doing so — something which White could have attempted to exploit with 15.c4. Whether Black takes (15...dxc4) or pushes his pawn, 16.Be4 would be White’s reply; and on 15...Bg6, White would have traded bishops (16.Bxg6 hxg6) and proceeded with 17.Rd1. Black would then have faced some difficult problems, but 16.Be4 would not have settled the outcome of the game: 15...d4 16.Be4 Qd7 would pose the dilemma for White of whether to sell his fine game for a mere pawn. After 17.Bxc6 Qxc6 18.Nxd4 Nxd4 19.Bxd4 Bg6, I rather prefer Black.
The positional text move does not cost White his advantage, but it does slow the game somewhat.
15.a5 Bg6
16.Nb3 bxc3
17.bxc3 Qb8
Szabo has spotted the basic shortcoming of his position, and decides to postpone castling until his queen has found a way to the battlefield (the threat was 18.Rd1 and 19.c4).
18.Qa2 0-0
19.Bxg6 hxg6
20.Rab1 Qb5
A chessmaster’s skill lies not so much in perceiving the correct plan as in carrying it out with exact and sometimes “only” moves. In the present case, we have White proceeding with his strategically correct play against the undeveloped queen, but selecting a technically inexact sequence: 20.Rfb1 was stronger. In that event, the a-pawn would have been defended, and the reply 20...Qb5, obviously, rendered impossible; while Vukovic’s recommendation of 20...Qd8 would be pointless, since the queen would be as it was before, with no field of activity; one possible line might be 21.Rd1, and if 21...Qd7, then 22.Nc5 Nxc5 23.Rxd5, etc., or 21...Rb8 22.Nbd4 Nexd4 23.Nxd4 Nxe5 24.Bf4, or 21...Na7 22.c4.
21.Qc2 ...
Gligoric’s desire to win this game exclusively by positional means, without recourse to any of the combinative possibilities, leads eventually to his downfall. 21.Nbd4 might fail to 21...Qxa5, but 21.Nfd4 was good: after 21...Nexd4 22.Nxd4 Qxa5, White sacrifices his queen — 23.Nxc6 Qxa2 24.Nxe7+ Kh7 25.Rb4 g5 26.Bxg5 g6 27.Rh4+ Kg7 28.Bf6 mate! — a finale that could be labeled the consistent conclusion to his plan. Of course, 21.Nfd4 would be better met by 21...Ncxd4 22.cxd4 Qd7 23.Rfc1, with a minimal edge.
21...Qc4
22.Nfd2 Qg4
23.f4 Qf5
24.Qxf5 gxf5
Black’s queen needed a long trek (Qd8-b8-b5-c4-g4-f5) to achieve the opportunity to exchange itself for White’s queen; only then were the two queens of equal value. After the trade, Black has the better of it, since the a-pawn is weak, and the pawns at e5 and f4 hem in White’s bishop. Summarizing the course of the struggle through the opening and middlegame, we could say that White’s powerful and consistent play netted him an advantage, which he might have exploited with 20.Rfb1; on the 21st move, White might have maintained approximate equality, or if Black were careless, a pretty combination could have been played. Having let slip all these opportunities, White must now endure a difficult endgame.
25.Nf3 Rfb8
26.Nfd4 Ncxd4
27.Nxd4 Nxd4
28.cxd4 ...
Taking with the pawn hems in the bishop still more severely, but 28.Bxd4 would result in a lost position after 28...Rb5 29.Rxb5 axb5 30.Ra1 Ra6 31.Kf1 Kf8.
28...Bb4
29.Ra1 Rb5
30.Ra4 Rab8
31.Rfa1 ...
After 31.Rc1, Black simply takes the pawn, and the pseudo-sacrifice of the exchange to recover it falls short: 31...Rxa5 32.Rxb4 Rxb4 33.Bd2 Rab5 34.Bxb4 Rxb4 35.Rxc7 Rxd4, and Black now has two passed pawns.
31...Bc3
32.Rc1 Rb1
33.Rxb1 Rxb1+
34.Kf2 Ra1
34...Rb5 would leave White the reply 35.Ra3 Bb4 36.Ra4, forcing the bishop to take the a-pawn; then, in order to untangle his pieces, Black would have to bring his king up from g8 all the way to b7 or b6.
35.Rxa1 Bxa1
36.Ke2 Bc3
37.Kd3 Bxa5
38.h3 ...
Despite his pawn minus, Gligoric had a beautiful positional draw here with 38.Bd2, and if 38...Bb6 39.Bb4, when it would be very difficult for Black to bring his king to the center, 39...f6 being met by 40.e6. In the pawn endgame after 38...Bxd2 39.Kxd2, the draw is clearer yet: for example, 39...Kf8 40.Kc3 Ke7 41.Kb4 Kd7 42.Kc5. White would not have had this chance, if Black had played 34...Rb5 instead of 34...Ra1 — yet another example demonstrating how one must always note and exploit the tiniest details in an endgame, and how useful it can be to know problem ideas.
38...Be1
Now the exchange of bishops does not come off, since Black can answer 39.Bd2 with 39...Bg3, gaining the tempo he needs to play 40...Kf8.

WHITE RESIGNED
41. Taimanov—Averbakh
(Nimzoindian Defense)
One of the tournament’s most interesting games, characterized by White’s persistent efforts to clear a path, by combinative means, for his fianchettoed queen’s bishop to reach the weakened kingside dark squares. Presentday defensive technique being what it is, however, the exploitation of a single weakness is not enough to win. White therefore had to accumulate other small advantages as well; at the decisive moment, all were necessary for the conclusive combination. The game acquires special interest, due to Averbakh’s exceptionally staunch and resourceful defense: at one point, it looked as though he had weathered every threat, but just then White found the means of reviving his attack. The finish was quite pretty.
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6
3.Nc3 Bb4
4.e3 0-0
5.Bd3 d5
6.Nf3 b6
7.0-0 Bb7
8.a3 ...
When Taimanov played this same line with Black against Szabo in the following round, White continued 8.Qe2, and Black was unable to save his king’s bishop from exchange, whereas here he could have played it back to d6. Averbakh, being unwilling to lose the time, gives up the bishop for the knight, to open his fianchettoed bishop’s diagonal by trading pawns on c4; only thereafter does he counterattack White’s center with his pawn on c5 and strategically placed pieces.
This plan is harmless enough to leave White’s hands free for operations on both flanks.
8...Bxc3
9.bxc3 dxc4

White quietly prepares e3-e4, for which Black has no better remedy than mechanical prevention. If he places his bishop on e4, then White can play 13.Bf1 (which would have been impossible after 12.Qe2), and the coming Nf3-d2 will make it impossible for Black’s bishop to keep White’s pawn on e3 for long.

...Rc7, ...Qa8, ...Rfc8, and ...Nf8 would have made a more rational defensive setup. A knight on f8 is one of the most economical ways of defending h7, and sometimes g7. The knight is much less well placed on f6 for defensive purposes, since it can be more easily attacked and driven away. The Qa8/Bb7 battery would not only control the a8- e4 diagonal, but might also threaten the pawn on g2 in certain lines. By removing his knight from d7, Black also gives e5 over too soon. Averbakh later concludes that the knight has to return.
15.Ne5 Rc7
16.a4 ...
Before continuing with his kingside operations, White creates favorable queenside pawn tension; by opening the a-file, he also greatly increases the scope of his rooks.
16...Nd6
17.a5 Nd7
18.axb6 axb6
19.Qh5 ...
Black has a number of defenses to this direct threat of mate. The problem is not so much the threat
per se
as the nature of the positional advantage White will derive from Black’s various replies. 19...Be4 suggests itself, but then there comes 20.Red1, and the lineup of queen on d8, knights on d7 and d6, and rook on d1 would be none too comfortable for Black. If 19...h6, then 20.Ng4, with the powerful threat 21.Nxh6+, .either immediately or after a preparatory d4-d5; and 19...f5 would deprive Black of the possibility of defending his king position at some future time by means of ...f7-f6. Averbakh did not want to bring the knight back to f6, because after 20.Qh3 he would still have to consider such threats as 21.Ng4 and 21.d5; on f6 the knight is exposed, and may easily be driven away from the defense of h7, as we have seen. The continuation Averbakh selects obviously weakens the dark squares, but he had a concrete variation in mind which brings a white pawn to e5, and thereby denies White’s bishop access to the squares f6, g7 and h6. Indeed, after
19...g6
20.Qh6 Nxe5
21.dxe5 Ne4
any retreat of the white king’s bishop allows 22...Qd2, and in this position, with its immobilized pawn chain, White’s bishops would pose no problem. But Taimanov’s brilliant
22.Bxe4 ...
ushers in a new and truly grand- masterly phase of the struggle, wherein both sides will have ample opportunity to display fantasy, calculation and technique.
22...Bxe4
23.Red1 Rd7
Thinking that the d-file threats had been met and that White would no longer be able to reach Black’s king after the exchange of rooks, Averbakh offered a draw. No doubt White’s self-evident reply must have escaped him completely.
24.Rd6 ...
White has taken over the d- file! If Black now exchanges rooks and stops the mate by 25...f6, then the other rook enters Black’s position via the a-file White was farsighted enough to have opened back on the 18th move.
24...Bb7
25.Rad1 ...
There are players who think “such moves cannot be bad”; curiously, however, this move is a clear loss of tempo. After 25...Rxd6, White recaptures with the pawn, not the rook, and for that he does not need a rook on d1. In order to keep up the pace of his attack, Taimanov should have substituted either 25.e4 or 25.h4.
25...Rxd6
Passive defense would allow White to strengthen his position decisively. One way would be to play e3-e4 and then transfer the rook via d3 to h3; another might be to bring the bishop via eland g5 to f6. In either event, f2-f4-f5, intending further exposure of Black’s king, would be a useful plan.
26.exd6 f6
Now the a1-h8 diagonal is blocked, and Black needs only one move, 27...Qd7, to parry his opponent’s main threats.
27.d7 ...
A powerful move! The pawn advances to certain death, but it will destroy the coordination of the black pieces. While Black occupies himself in dealing with the pawn, White’s pieces will take up still more active positions
Let’s make it White’s move here. Do you see a pretty queen sacrifice? — 27...-- 28.Qxf8+ Kxf8 29.Bxf6. To meet this threat, Black could move his rook to f7 (27...Rf7), attacking the pawn as well, but then we get the echo-variation 28.Qh3 f5 29.Qh6 Rxd7 30.Qg7+ (the queen sacrifices itself on a different dark square) 30...Rxg7 31.Rxd8+. Black’s move draws the sting from the threatened (27...Bc6) 28.Qxf8+, since he can now meet 28...Kxf8 29.Bxf6 with 29...Qxd7.
27...Bc6
I believe there was a more radical solution to the problem of defending the entire diagonal in 27...e5, which would also flow quite logically from Black’s last few moves. For example:
I. 28.h4 Rf7 29.h5 Rxd7 30.Rxd7 Qxd7 31.hxg6 hxg6 32.Qxg6+ Qg7
II. 28.f4 Rf7 29.fxe5 Rxd7 30.Rf1 Rd1
III. 28.Qh3 Qe7, and White seems to have no means of preventing the maneuver ...Rd8, ...Bc6
27...Bc6 solves part of the problem by getting rid of the pawn on d7, but that’s not enough for this complex position. Now Taimanov injects new life into his attack: throwing his pawns into the fray, he finally succeeds in breaking through to the black king.
28.h4 Bxd7
29.h5 ...
By now, the atmosphere has become so thick that the combinations have begun to flicker here and there, like heat-lightning. If the pawn advances now (29...g5), the pawn that stood on d7 makes possible the sacrifice 30.Bxf6. If the queen takes, White obtains a winning rook endgame with the positional capital accumulated in the very beginning of the game; and if the rook takes (30...Rxf6), then 31.Qxg5+ Kf7 32.h6 e5 (32...Qe7 33.Rxd7) 33.Rd6.
29...gxh5
30.e4 ...
Opens the high road, d1-d3-g3, for his rook. In reply, Black opens the road to g4 for his bishop, so as to stop the rook here, at least, but it won’t be here...
30...e5
31.f4 ...
King’s Gambit, Taimanov’s Interpretation: a complete success.
31...exf4
On 31...Qe7 32.fxe5 fxe5 33.Rd5 decides, as Black can no longer defend the e-pawn; but now the a1-h8 diagonal is open again, and even though the pawn still stands at f6, Black can no longer evade catastrophe.

2.c4 d6
3.Nf3 g6
4.g3 Bg7
5.Bg2 0-0
6.0-0 Nc6
An idea peculiar to the King’s Indian: Black immediately joins battle for d4, inviting White to push his pawn to d5 with gain of time. What does this lead to, however? One fianchettoed bishop begins irritating White’s most sensitive spots, while its opposite number gets walled in behind its own pawn. There would be some point to 7.d5 if the knight had to return to b8 or at least to go to e5, when White could exchange knights and then set up a majority attack with his queenside pawns. But the knight goes to a5 instead, from which it can never be driven: for instance, 7.d5 Na5 8.Qa4 c5!, with an excellent game.
7.Nc3 Bg4
Continuing the fight for d4, Black next trades off the knight which controls that square.
8.h3 Bxf3
9.Bxf3 Nd7
Repeating his invitation to advance the pawn to d5. 10.e3 is met by 10...e5, and if 11.d5 then, not 11...Na5, but 11...Ne7, with ...f7-f5 to follow. And if White continues to fight for d4 with 10.e3 e5 11.Ne2, then 11...exd4 12.exd4 Qf6.
10.Bg2 ...
Najdorf wearies of this obstinacy; so, with a negligent wave at the d4-pawn, he retreats his bishop, so that now, after e2-e3 etc., Black’s queen will no longer come out to f6 with an attack on the bishop at f3. If White was in some way forced to exchange his d-pawn for Black’s b-pawn, then Black has gained a signal strategical success in the opening, for the two pawns are worlds apart in value.
10...Nxd4
11.Bxb7 Rb8
12.Bg2 c5
A serious positional error; just how serious it is will be made clear to the reader by the explanation which follows.
Black controls an open queen- side file, and can easily force White to play b2-b3. After that, his plan will be to advance his a-pawn to attack the pawn at b3. This plan can only succeed if Black can support his pawn to a4, but with what? He no longer has his lightsquare bishop, and his last move deprived his knight of its proper square. It will also become clear quite soon that his knight cannot be maintained on d4 for long, and the light squares on the queenside are under the control of White’s fianchettoed bishop — thus, Black’s knights have no good squares. As a matter of fact, Black’s knights end up in pitiable positions.
Thus, Black has no plan with a future to it. He can make moves — some of them, no doubt, will be fairly good; he still need not lose the game, but he has already lost the guiding thread, so his position is consequently inferior. We recommend that the reader study this game in conjunction with the Najdorf — Geller game from Round 28. There Black played 12...Rb4!, and followed this up with ...Ne5, inducing both f2-f4 and b2-b3; then he re-positioned his knight on c5, and, despite Najdorf’s resourceful counter-play on the queenside, carried out the required attack on the pawn at b3.

Black has done all one could ask: he has induced 16.b3 and advanced his pawn to a5 — what he can do further, however, is a mystery. Nor can one find any advice to offer him, other than to avoid weaknesses and not to leave pieces
en prise
(which was the principle behind such moves as 18...Ned8 and 19...Kh8). Meanwhile, White is all set for many moves’ worth of straightforward, logical strengthening of his position: for example, Na4, Bc3 and the exchange of bishops, followed by f2-f4, Bf3, Kg2, h3-h4-h5, Rh1, etc. This is only a sketch, of course; in actual play, Black would not likely stand still, but there can be no denying that all the chances in this fight would be with White, the more so in that any attempt to bring the pawn at e7 into the fight would result in an irreparable weakening of the pawn at d6.

5.Nc3 d6
6.Nf3 c5
7.d5 Na6
A setup quite similar to that of Bronstein - Najdorf, from Round Two, the only difference being that here the white king’s bishop is on g2, not d3. This circumstance promises Black better chances from his idea of ...Nb8-a6-c7 followed by ...a7-a6 and ...b7-b5, since the white bishop is less effective here, and White has spent an extra tempo on 3.g3.
8.0-0 Nc7
9.e4 a6
10.a4 Rb8
11.Re1 b5
The opening battle grows very tense: if White takes twice on b5, his center will end up very sad-looking indeed: 12.axb5 axb5 13.cxb5 Nxb5 14.Nxb5 Rxb5. Following classical principles, Averbakh answers this wing attack with a counterblow in the center, even at the cost of material.

Bravery, verging on bravado: Black cannot take on b2 or on d5, in view of the terrific threat of 18.Nxc4, when the pawn at d6 must fall as well. Najdorf must hold on to c4 at all costs, while simultaneously keeping track of how many pieces are attacking and defending his pinned knight on f6.
17...Rb4
18.Rc1
18.Qf3 leads to nothing: after the surprising 18...Ncxd5, it is Black who wins.
DRAW
It’s hard to predict who might have won, had the game continued, but certainly a draw would have been the least likely outcome.
Najdorf offered the draw because he considered his position insecure, and Averbakh may have agreed because he could not see precisely how he was going to recover his pawn. The players should have exchanged places — more than likely, they would have continued the game then. Najdorf gave the following variations to justify the draw: 18...Ba6 19.Bf1 h6 20.Nxf6+ Bxf6, followed by either 21.Bxh6 Re8 22.Rxe8+ Qxe8 23.Nxc4 Bxc4 24.Bxc4 Bxb2 25.Rc2, or the better line 21.Bxf6 Qxf6 22.Ne4 Qd8 23.Qd2 Kh7 24.Qf4 Ne8 25.Rc2, with even chances.
It seems to me that 18.Rc1 was the mistake: the rook stood well on the a-file too. A good move with the same idea of attacking the c—pawn would have been 18.Bf1, especially since the bishop does not defend the d-pawn anyway. In this line, almost every white piece would stand well, and the threat of 19.Qf3 would be strengthened. A rough idea of the seriousness of the pin on Black’s king’s knight may be gathered from the following variation: 18.Bf1 Ba6 19.Rxa6 Nxa6 20.Qf3, and there is no further defense available for f6 (the proper move would be 18...Bf5, and not 18...Ba6).
44. Szabo—Taimanov

Here or on the next move, White could — indeed, by the logic of things he must — start his central pawns moving: for example, with 17.d5 exd5 18.cxd5 Ndf6 19.Bxf6 Nxf6 20.e4. His next two moves do little to improve his position: the rooks would have been better posted a little to the right.
17.Rac1 h6 18.Rfd1 cxd4 19.exd4 Rfd8 20.Qb3 Nd6 21.Qb4 Nb8 22.d5 exd5 23.cxd5 Rxc1 24.Bxc1 Na6
The pawns have advanced, under less favorable conditions than before, but still White stands rather well: he has a passed pawn and some attacking chances.

One of the ritual lines of the King’s Indian. Deviate one step from the “correct” move order, and the theoreticians will instantly brand the offending game with that most dread taboo: either “±” or “∓”.
15.g4? ...
But what’s this? The High Priest of Theoreticians himself, making the sort of move to baffle his opponent, and the reader too — and to what end? Firstly, to hinder the usual ...f7-f5; secondly, to swing the knight over to g3, and only then to play f2-f4, since this advance would be premature here (it was Tarrasch’s opinion that f2-f4 is nearly always premature); and thirdly, to push the pawn up to g5, if circumstances warrant.
These are the surface points of 15.g4, but we may also guess at something bolder: to station the knight on g3 and the bishop on e2, and at the right moment go over to the assault with h3-h4-h5... It’s amazing that a move with so many good ideas behind it could be bad, but there is so much piece tension in the center that such a wing attack cannot succeed. White does not even get time enough to bring his knight to g3, to say nothing of his other castles in the air.
15...Qa5
16.Bf1 ...
Overprotecting the c-pawn, so as to be able to meet 16...Ne5 with 17.f4.

Once again threatening 17.-- 17...Ne5; if then 18.f4 Nxd4!, followed by the knight check on f3.
17.Kg2 h5

Dashing one of his hopes: now he will never get to play h3-h4.
19...Ne5
20.Nce2 Nxd4
Here Gligoric, who has been playing wonderfully, begins a direct attack. I would prefer not to have traded off this knight yet, moving it instead to c5 or to f8, and threatening 21...d5 under still more favorable circumstances.
21.Nxd4 d5
Consistently pursuing his plan of opening up the center: his attack will have an easier time finding the king with the e-pawn out of the way.
22.exd5 cxd5
White had prepared a pretty refutation for 22...Nxg4: 23.fxg4 Bxd4 24.Bxd4 Rxe1 25.Bc3.
23.Nb5 dxc4
24.Nd6 ...
Allowing a remarkable two-piece sacrifice, which would have been a most fitting conclusion for this game.
24...Be6
The combination begins with 24...Nxf3, and continues 25.Kxf3 Bxg4+ 26.Kxg4 Qh5+ 27.Kg3 Be5+ 28.Kf2 Bxd6, threatening 29...Re5; or 25.Nxe8 Nxe1+ 26.Rxe1 Qxe1; or 25.Bxc4 Nxe1+ 26.Rxe1 Be6.
25.Nxe8 Rxe8
26.Qc3 ...
A brave decision, trading queens. It’s hard to say whether Euwe saw all of the possible variations after 26...Qb5 27.Bd4 Bd5, but most likely his intuition told him that he could save himself, and perhaps do even better than that, with the problem move 28.Kg3. Then, if the knight takes on f3 (28...Nxf3), White trades rooks with check (29.Rxe8+ Qxe8) and captures the king’s bishop (30.Bxg7); if the bishop takes on f3 instead, White takes the knight, coming out a piece to the good; and on 28...f6, White takes first on e5 (29.Bxe5), and then on d5 with the rook. In the line 26...Qb5 27.Bd4 Bd5 28.Kg3 Bxf3 29.Bxe5 Bxd1 30.Bxg7 Rxe1 31.Qxe1 Kxg7 32.Qxd1 Qxb2, Black might have some hope for a draw.
26...Qxc3
27.bxc3 Nc6
28.Bb6 ...
The bishop had a much better move: 28.Bc5 would have given White serious winning chances. If 28...Bxc3, 29.Re3 and 30.Bxc4; if 28...Rc8, 29.Re3 Bh6 30.Rxe6 fxe6 31.Bxc4 Nd8 32.Bb4 Rxc4 33.Rxd8+.
28.Bb6 looks strong, since the pawn is blockaded; but as we shall soon see, Euwe has overlooked Black’s 29th, which wins the c-pawn for nothing.
28...Bxc3
29.Re4 Ba5
Euwe had expected to recover the pawn at c4, but now he saw that after the exchange of bishops this pawn will be defended by the knight. White must therefore reorient himself to a long and arduous defense. The outcome of the game will turn on whether or not Black can succeed in connecting his passed pawns.
30.Bxa5 Nxa5
31.Re5 b6
32.Rb5 ...
White tries to make the black pawns operate separately, and to keep them from getting too far advanced.
32...c3
33.Rc1 Rc8
34.Rb4 ...
This saves the game. White captures the a-pawn, instead of the relatively harmless b-pawn. After 34.Rxb6 Bxa2, there would be no defense against the advance of the c-pawn, with Black’s bishop and knight clearing its path: for example, 35.Rb5 Nb3 36.Rc2 Bb1.
34...Bxa2
35.Rxa4 Bd5
If 35...Nb3 now, 36.Re1 c2 37.Rxa2 c1=Q 38.Rxc1 Rxc1 39.Ra8+ Kg7 40.Rb8, with a draw. The text renews the threat of 36...Nb3.
36.Rb4 Nb3
37.Rc2 Na1
38.Rc1 Nb3
39.Rc2 Nd2
In time-pressure, Gligoric spurns the repetition of moves, overlooks the loss of a piece, and almost loses, to be saved only by his passed pawn.

46. Stahlberg—Bronstein
(Queen’s Indian Defense)
Stahlberg is a most enjoyable opponent for the King’s Indian enthusiast, since he generally prefers sharp, lively continuations over theoretical lines. However, he played the White side of the King’s Indian so strongly against Boleslavsky in Round One that I could not muster the courage to repeat that opening against him. So I managed instead to pick another system that he knows very well, from which he secured a sizable advantage.
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6
3.Nf3 b6
4.e3 Bb7
5.Bd3 Be7
6.Nc3 d5
7.Qa4+ ...
The point to this check is that, of the three possible piece interpositions, none is any good: 7...Nbd7 is met by 8.cxd5 exd5 9.Ne5; 7...Qd7 is met by 8.Qc2, and the coming Ne5 will gain a tempo; and finally, if the other knight covers, its colleague is deprived of its natural square. Thus, Black must use his pawn, which closes the bishop’s diagonal temporarily. Stahlberg immediately exchanges on d5, forcing the e-pawn recapture, which in turn practically forces an eventual ...c6-c5.
7...c6

I would have preferred 13.Ne2, keeping the option of recapturing on d4 with a knight, and meeting 13...Rc8 with 14.Qb1.
13...cxd4
Black closes the bishop’s diagonal, taking advantage of the fact that White will be a long while bringing this piece back into play at f4. A nearly symmetrical position results, but white’s lightsquare bishop is still the more actively developed.

Of course, with all those pieces on the board, there’s still lots of play left; but if White offers the draw in such a position, Black really cannot refuse.

White wanted to hold his e2-e4 for a while yet, but now we see how Black’s King’s Indian may also become a Grunfeld. white’s next move is illogical, allowing Black to capture the c-pawn under circumstances which render its recovery rather problematic.
5.Bg2 dxc4

Kotov wants his pawn back at all costs, even two tempi; but that could have cost him the game.

12.Nxc6 ...
12...Nd3+
Keres could not resist giving this pretty knight check, crowning the knight’s far-ranging expedition with the capture of bishop and queen. This mustang’s biography was an extensive one: eight of the first fifteen moves, checks to both queen and king, eating queen, bishop and knight, and saddling White with a weak pawn at c3 — certainly enough activity for all of the pieces in any other game!
Even here, 12...bxc6 13.0-0 Qb6 14.Rd1 Ba6! 15.Qc2 Rad8 wouldn’t have been a bad idea: Black’s positional advantage is clear enough.
13.Kd2 ...
Coldly accurate defense! On any other retreat, as we shall see immediately, the c-pawn would not have been defended after move 16, and the king would have stood much worse besides.
13...Nxc1+
14.Nxd8 Nxe2
15.Nxb7 Nxc3
16.bxc3 Be6
This is the sort of position in which White is lost despite his being a pawn ahead. His minor pieces are scattered, his c-pawn is weak, and his rooks are subject to the harassment of the beautifully coordinated black bishops. The proper move for Black here would appear to have been 16...Bf5!, keeping White’s rooks from the b-file, and preventing them from doubling on the c-file; he would also be threatening a check from d8 at his earliest convenience, driving white’s king away from its pawn. White would have had to play 17.e4, shutting off his own bishop and making it that much easier for his opponent.
After the text, Kotov manages to keep afloat with amazing skill: for many moves, he maintains his terminally ill pawn
inter vivos
, and eventually pulls himself nearly even.

The c-pawn is doomed; the only question is whether White will be able to get any sort of compensation for it. He would be happy, for example, to be able to arrange a trade of knight for bishop, or to clear away all of the minor pieces. (One complicating factor is that, as a result of the unusual opening, both sides were already in time trouble.)

Fighting spirit triumphs over common sense: Kotov declines a draw that was his for the taking, in order to obtain by dint of great effort a problem draw some twenty moves later — and the art of chess is the winner. More than likely, though, he simply overlooked, in his fierce time trouble, that Black could take the e-pawn.

The beauty of this move becomes evident in the main variation: 43...f5 44.Rd7+ Kf8 45.Nf6 Rxf2+ 46.Ke1. White’s 43rd move deserves its exclamation mark, but so does his previous move, which drove Black’s king to the seventh rank. Had White played 42.Rd6 immediately (with the black king on g8), Black would have played 42...f5 and won after 43.Rd8+ Kf7; but if the king tries to go to f7 now, to avoid the perpetual, the f-pawn is lost: 43...f5 44.Rd7+ Kg6 45.Rd6+ Kf7 46.Rf6+ and 47.Rxf5. The practical execution of White’s plan, then, required a black pawn at f7.
Having safely weathered the worst of the storm, White finds little to fear in the rest of it: by giving up his a-pawn, he secures Black’s h-pawn in return, and gets his draw.

In Samisch’s Attack against the Nimzo-Indian, the plans for both sides are generally determined at an early stage. White accepts doubled pawns, with the c4-pawn especially weak (one might almost say doomed) in order to facilitate a rapid usurpation of the center by means of e3-e4, leading to a kingside attack with f2-f4 (-f5, if Black allows). Master practice has shown that Black gets good counterplay if he gets time for ...f5, blocking the king’s wing; while White can only carry his attack through if he can neutralize Black’s queenside activity and prevent ...f5. White must play very energetically to achieve his ends, and from this standpoint, castling is a waste of time here.
9...Ba6
10.e4 Ne8
11.Qa4 ...
I don’t see this as being any place for a queen, which should be reinforcing White’s kingside threats. More in the spirit of the system White has selected would be 11.f4 f5 12.Ng3, with threats of 13.d5 or 13.e5; or 11.Ng3 first. In any event, White should be developing his game in this direction, and not queenside, where the queen is so passive. If Black answers 11.f4 with 11...Na5, attacking the c-pawn, then 12.dxc5 bxc5 13.Be3, when White seizes the b- and d-files and plays e5 with a very strong game.
11...Qc8
Smyslov spent about an hour on this move, and found an excellent plan: he defends c6 and a6, indirectly attacks the c-pawn (after an eventual ...c5xd4), and answers 12.dxc5 with 12...Ne5.
12.Be3 d6
13.Rad1 Na5
14.dxc5 ...
In the new situation, this exchange is not justified, since Black has had time to play 12...d6 and can now recapture with the d-pawn. From Geller, one might sooner have expected 14.d5!; although he might lose the c-pawn later, this is not all that important — one pawn is not necessarily the game. White would also have obtained fair kingside chances then.
14...dxc5
15.e5 Qc6

Of course, White will not exchange queens, since then he would lose the c-pawn with no compensation.

White retreats into passive defense, which renders his game strategically lost. Instead, he might have played 17.exf6 Nxf6 18.Bg5 Bxc4 19.Bxf6 Bxd3 20.Rxd3 Rxf6 21.c4, keeping the knight out of c4 and setting up strong pressure along the d-file. Black’s win in that case would have been far from simple: for instance, 21...Raf8 22.f3 Nb7 23.Rfd1, intending Ne2-g3-e4.
17...Qa4
18.Nf4 Nc7
19.Bc2 Qe8
The point to this fine queen maneuver is that by threatening to win the c-pawn Black gains time to deny White’s knight the square h5, and forces white’s bishop to the inferior square b3, where it will be completely out of play. Now White cannot return his bishop to d3.

White’s next move exploits an accidental tactical chance — the somewhat exposed state of Black’s king — to bring the queen over to the kingside. However, this has no material effect on the outcome, since the best White can achieve out of an attack on the king with his lone queen is an exchange of queens and an obviously lost endgame.

By trading off his good bishop for Black’s bad one, White keeps Black’s knight from developing: on c8, this piece is hemmed in by the white pawn at c5, and on e7, by the white pawn at e4. Not only does the knight have nowhere to go, it interferes with the rest of the pieces. White’s combination of queen on f3, bishop on c4 and rook on d7 promises to wind up the game in short order.

Reshevsky seized his head in his hands, glanced nervously at his flag (ready to fall at any moment) and the position, and — took the bishop with check.

One of many “possible, though not best” continuations. Its apparent goal — to place the bishop at b1, the queen at c2 and mate the black king on h7 — is too lightweight; while its true aim — advancing the pawns to c4 and d5, opening the diagonal for the fianchettoed white queen’s bishop — is somewhat convoluted, since these same pawns also close up the diagonal of his other bishop.
I think White should play here moves which support the push e3-e4-e5.
11...e5

14.c4 Bxf3
15.gxf3 Qd7
Looking at its structure alone without regard to the time factor, White’s position is good: he could play Kh1, Rg1, Bb2, Bb1, etc. The trouble is that Black has completed his development before White, and can begin his attack first: already he threatens 16...Qh3 and ...Ne7-g6-h4. As a result, White must resort to desperate measures in order to avert a swift catastrophe.
16.Bb1 ...
White has not the time to regroup with Kh1 and Rg1, for example: 16.Kh1 Qh3 17.Qe2 e4 18.Rg1 exf3 19.Qf1 Ng4 20.Qxh3 Nxf2 mate; however, this was the line he should have chosen, but with the exchange sacrifice 18.fxe4! Ng4 19.f4 Nxh2 20.Qg2 Qxg2+ 21.Kxg2, with strong center pawns. Now, although White has defended against the threat of 16...Qh3 (when there would follow 17.Bb2 Qxf3 18.Bxe5), his position is too passive and his rooks are disconnected.
16...Ng6
17.Qf5 Qxf5
18.Bxf5 Nh4
19.Be4 ...
A stock position illustrating the strength of the two knights and their advantage over the two bishops. One bishop is locked in a cell measuring a3 by c1 by e3; the other is chained to the pawn at f3. Both bishops are absolutely impotent, and White has no useful moves. The knights will continue to dominate the bishops as long as the pawn chain remains immobile, so White’s best chance was to retreat the bishop to c2 in an attempt to open the game.
19...Nxe4
Succumbing to the spell of the Two Bishops, Euwe hurriedly exchanges one of them, even though he had the excellent move 19...Rae8.
20.fxe4 f5
21.f5 ...
Taimanov easily acquired a passed d-pawn in the early opening, and then apparently forgot about it. By itself, certainly, it would cause Black no great discomfort; but if it were to receive a bit of support, its power would grow by leaps and bounds.
21.f4 would have been very much to the point here: however Black might reply, he could not prevent the appearance of the pawn-pair d5-e5 — a chance White would not have had, if Black had not been so hasty with his 20...f5. 20...Rae8 was still possible, with ...f5 only thereafter. There was no reason to rush matters (since White could hardly have effected any substantial change in the position in one move), and Black’s forces would then be completely mobilized.
21...e4
A slight inaccuracy, affording White an amazing defensive opportunity; his position would have been very difficult after 21...Nf3+ and only then 22...e4. The threats of 23...Rxf5 followed by ...Rg5+ and ...Rh5, as well as ...Ra8-d8-d6, look so strong and dangerous that it is hard to imagine how White might have wriggled out.
22.f4
A memorable move indeed. Taimanov is the great optimist of the chessboard, always happy with his position, and sometimes a trifle slow to sense approaching difficulties. However, when the wolf is at the door, his resourcefulness, combined with his far-seeing powers of calculation, draws from the deepest reserves of his position such possibilities as to astound not only his opponent, but chess fans everywhere.
The plan he comes up with here dooms all five of his central pawns, in order to reach a position in which rook and two rook pawns successfully hold off rook and four pawns.

A nice in-between check. Its point appears by comparing what might have occurred, had Black merely played his rook to d4 at once: 27...Rd4 28.Re7 Rxd5 29.Rxb7 Rdxf5 30.Rxf5 Rxf5 31.Rxa7, with a draw. Now, however, White’s king must go to the f-file, so that in this line the f-pawn falls with check. Thus, White must find a move other than 30.Rxb7.
28.Kf2 Rd4
29.Re7 Rxd5
30.f6 ...
Very good! Many players know how to convert their advantage into a win; it is a far more difficult thing to convert the opponent’s advantage into nothing. With 30.f6, White intends to split Black’s g- and h-pawns, and I am still not convinced that Euwe’s 30...Rxf6 was best. Here’s an interesting alternative: 30...g6 31.Rg7+ Kh8 32.Rxb7 c4 33.Rc7 Rd6, etc.
30...Rxf6
31.Rxf6 gxf6
32.Rxb7 a5
33.Rb5 a4
33...Rf5+ 34.Ke3 Re5+ 35.Kf4 c4 was somewhat better.
34.Ra5 Rd4
35.Rxc5 ...
Advising is always easier than playing the game oneself. A more stubborn defense was 35.Ra7, winning control of the seventh rank, but to refuse the c-pawn, with a two-pawn deficit? One can only advise such moves... Nevertheless, the outcome would not have been all that clear, even with Black’s two extra pawns: in order to free his king, Black would have had to give back his a-pawn. After that, White’s task would be to trade off his a-pawn for Black’s c-pawn, throwing in his h-pawn as well, if necessary: sometimes one can draw the ending against the f-and h-pawns.
After 35.Rxc5, White also gets his rook to a7, but Black keeps his a-pawn. The main objection to 35.Rxc5, however, is that White doesn’t even win his pawn back, since Black’s ...Rd4-d3xa3 maneuver reestablishes the two-pawn margin.
35...Rd3
36.Ra5 Rxa3

6.Bg2 Nxc3
We all know the basic idea of the Grunfeld is to attack the pawn center, and especially the d-pawn; so why does Black strengthen d4 and open the b-file for White, without being forced to do so?
There are many reasons for it, chief among them the fact that the knight had no good retreat square. Additionally, Black does not lose a tempo, and he removes a strong enemy knight. If the b-file is opened, the c-file is also closed; he may be strengthening the d-pawn, but he is also isolating the a-pawn, and weakening the b-pawn by bringing it to c3 and detaching it from its pawn chain. So 6...Nxc3 does have its logic.
7.bxc3 c5
8.e3 0-0
Of course, Black will have a difficult time collapsing d4, but that is not to say it will be impossible. One of the peculiarities of central pawn tension is that Black may trade on d4 at any suitable moment, while White can almost never take on c5. On the other hand, as we shall note more than once, the move 7...c5 enhances the power of White’s fianchettoed bishop.
9.Ne2 Nc6
10.0-0 Qa5
10...Na5 would have been in the style of Capablanca, who loved clear, effective plans: it attacks the weakened square c4, with a natural followup something like 11...Bd7, 12...cxd4 13...Rc8, 14...Bc6, etc. The text move could have been met powerfully by 11.a4, threatening 12.Ba3, when white’s position would glow with all the colors of the rainbow. (Ba3 must not be played too hastily, however: 11.a4 Rd8 12.Ba3 Bg4, and the bishop’s diagonal has to be closed by 13.f3, since 13.Bxc5 allows 13...Qxc5. So the right move would be 11.a4 Rd8 12.Qb3, and then 13.Ba3.)
11.Qb3 ...
In Morphy’s time, such a move was played with the intention of attacking f7; here, the queen’s eye is on b7.
White has apparently attained his goal first, and retarded the queen’s bishop’s development.
11...Bg4!
Following Morphy’s example, Black is ready to sacrifice a pawn for development: for example, 12.f3 Be6, followed by:
a) 13.d5 c4 14.Qxb7 Bxd5;
b) 13.Qxb7 Bc4;
c) 13.Qa3 Bc4 14.Qxa5 Nxa5 15.Rd1 Rac8 16.Ba3 b6 17.f4 Rfd8
— in all lines, Black obtains a fully equal game.
12.Nf4 e5
If White’s knight were not at f4, his pawn could, passing safely between Scylla and Charybdis, as it were, cause Black no little anguish; but now White’s stronghold on d4 is attacked from four sides at once, and his center collapses into formless rubble.
13.dxe5 Nxe5
14.h3 ...
White has much the worse of it. He cannot take on b7 with his queen (14.Qxb7? Rab8 15.Qe7 Qxc3, and White loses a whole piece), nor with his bishop (for the same reason: 14.Bxb7 Rab8 15.Qd5 Bf3 or 15...Rxb7, etc., with an irresistible attack). White’s only chance to equalize is to set up the formation Nd5 and e3-e4, but right now he cannot play either 14.Nd5 Be2 15.Re1 Nf3+ 16.Bxf3 Bxf3, when his game is lost; or 14.e4 Nf3+ 15.Kh1 Bxc3 16.Rb1 Nd4 17.Qxb7 Qxa2. So Najdorf’s 14.h3 is played to determine the intentions of this bishop.
14...Bf3
15.Bxf3 Nxf3+
16.Kg2 Ne5
17.e4 b5
Szabo’s hot-blooded nature rejects the strong positional line 17...Qa6, although it is wholly logical and embodies a number of healthy ideas: controlling the light squares, severely weakened by the exchange of the fianchettoed bishop; defending the b-pawn; increasing the queen’s radius of activity; and impeding the development of the knight, since 18.Nd5 would be met by 18...Qe2!
The strength of 17...Qa6 lies not merely in abstract ideas, but also in concrete variations: for example, 18.Qa3 Qc4, or 18.Ba3 b6, or 18.Be3 c4 19.Qc2 Nd3. If 18.f3, the weakening of the second rank must tell sooner or later (see Game 85, Stahlberg - Szabo).
Szabo’s bumptious 17...b5 leads almost by force to an equal endgame.
18.Be3 c4
19.Qc2 Nd3
Otherwise 20.Bd4!, and the scales begin to tip in White’s favor.

Szabo may have overlooked this move — it happens to grandmasters too, sometimes. Still, there was nothing significantly better.
26...bxc4
27.Rxa5 Bxa5

DRAW
If the bishop were still on g7, Black would have had some slight winning chances, but now after 28...Rb8 29.Rc1 c3 30.Bd4 Rb2 31.Bxc3 Bxc3 32.Rxc3 Rxa2, the draw is clear.

(Queen’s Gambit)
1.c4 Nf6
2.Nc3 e6
3.Nf3 d5
4.e3 Be7
5.d4 0-0
6.Bd3 ...
White prepares a calm transposition into the Rubinstein Variation, fianchettoing the second bishop; Averbakh finds a good counter, exchanging pawns to transpose into the Queen’s Gambit Accepted with an extra tempo for Black, thanks to White’s two bishop moves (Bf1-d3 and Bd3xc4).

DRAW
If one desires an explanation of such quick draws, which occur in every tournament, one must keep in mind that such an event lasts more than one day. Many things happen over the course of thirty rounds that have a bearing on the fighting abilities of the people who play chess. In the present case, Petrosian’s peaceable disposition and Averbakh’s too, in part, may have been due to the previous round, which went badly for both. After the extra rest day they gave themselves with this eighth-round game, Petrosian went on to win three straight games in good style (an exceptional achievement by any standard in such a strong tourney); while Averbakh, though perhaps not quite so fortunate, still fought with great verve in the rounds that followed.
In major tournaments, one must ration one’s strength, not for the individual game, but for the entire event, taken as a whole. The history of chess events — and that of many other sports as well — contains many cases in which one of the participants forged ahead at the outset, only to lose game after game towards the end (and not against his most powerful opponents, either), finishing far behind the winners.
(back to the text)
Now Black has only to push his f-pawn to the third rank, and even the best possible position for White — Ra7, Kf2; Black — Ra1, Kh8 — is lost,
because of the standard maneuver ...Ra1-h1 (1...Rh1).
ROUND NINE
57. Szabo—Petrosian
(Queen’s Gambit)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6
3.Nc3 d5
4.Bg5 Be7
5.e3 0-0
6.Nf3 h6
7.Bh4 b6
The direct and most natural attempt to solve the problem of the queen’s bishop. For a long time, White used to get the better of it with 8.cxd5 exd5 9.Ne5; Pillsbury won a number of games that way. The system was revived recently when Bondarevsky and Makogonov decided that after 7...b6 it made little sense to block the diagonal a8-h1 with a pawn; so they began recapturing, after 8.cxd5, with the knight instead. Now, should White reply to 8...Nxd5 with 9.Bxe7 Qxe7 10.Nxd5, so that Black must suffer a pawn on d5 anyway, then the bishop shows its flexibility by developing to e6, rather than to b7. Thus, the Bondarevsky-Makogonov Defense proves completely viable, and now on occasion it is White who, as here, deviates from the main line.
8.Bd3 Bb7
9.0-0 Nbd7
10.Rc1 ...
A little change from the usual 10.Qe2 Ne4 11.Bg3 Nxg3 12.fxg3. After the text move, Black refrains from 10...Ne4, since White does not retreat to g3, but takes on e7 (11.Bxe7) instead, without fearing 11...Nxc3 12.Bxd8 Nxd1 (no check) 13.Rfxd1 Rfxd8 14.cxd5 exd5 15.Rxc7. And if 11...Qxe7 instead, then 12.cxd5 exd5 13.Nxe4 dxe4 14.Rxc7 is possible: after 14...Bc8 15.Bb5 exf3 16.Qxf3 Rb8 17.Rxa7, White would have three pawns for the piece plus a powerful position.
10...c5
11.Qe2 a6
Black has brought out all his minor pieces, but his development is far from complete. He will have a hard time finding good positions for his heavy pieces, while White’s rooks and queen are developing very nicely. The text move prepares the maneuver 12.-- 12...dxc4 13.Bxc4 b5; then 14...Qb6, followed by the development of the rooks to c8 andd8. Black still loses an important tempo, however, when 11...dxc4 12.Bxc4 Ne4 would have eased his defense.
12.cxd5 exd5
Recapturing with the knight (12...Nxd5) would have suited the spirit of this opening better: if then 13.Bxe7 Qxe7 14.Nxd5 Bxd5, with a comfortable game for Black. On 15.e4, the bishop simply retreats to b7, while if 15.Bxa6, Black could recapture at a2, although I would prefer 15...Bxf3 16.gxf3 cxd4 17.exd4 Nf6, with good prospects, now that the knight has the d5 and f4 squares.
Petrosian probably disliked 12...Nxd5 because of the simple reply 13.Bg3.
13.dxc5 bxc5
14.Rfd1 Re8
15.Bc2 Qb6
16.Bb3 ...
Black’s hanging pawns are weak. Szabo carries out a typical maneuver, Bd3-c2-b3, in order to induce the advance of one pawn, which weakens the other, and gives White an important central support point.
16...c4
17.Ba4 ...
Now, with the knight pinned against the rook, White threatens Bxf6 as well as 18.Bxd7 and Nxd5, forcing Petrosian to trade off one of the d-pawn’s defenders. However, Szabo should not have contented himself with this, when he had an opportunity to combine his attack on the d-pawn with threats to Black’s king. Having induced Black to play his bishop to c6, he ought to have brought his bishop back to c2, thus: 17...Bc6 18.Bc2! Rab8 19.Nd4 Ba8 20.Rb1, and Black’s game creaks at every joint: White is threatening both 21.Bg3 and 21.Nf5.
17...Bc6
18.Bxc6 Qxc6
19.b3 ...
Szabo has been bitten by a fatal idea: to attack the d5-pawn on the c4 square. With this one thoughtless move 1) he weakens an entire cluster of dark squares in his position; 2) he knocks the supports out from under his queen’s knight; and 3) he makes Black’s bishop better by giving it the chance to move out either to b4 or to a3.
Either 19.Nd4 and 20.Nf5, or 19.Rc2 and 20.Rcd2 would have been correct here. The pawn stood quite well at b2, and it should not have been disturbed.
19...Rac8
20.Na4 ...
This must have been the result of a miscalculation, since the knight returns at once; but the queen’s position improves meanwhile, and now White must consider how to defend his knight on c3.
20...Qb5
21.Nc3 Qa5
22.Bxf6 Nxf6
23.bxc4 dxc4
24.Nd2 ...
By now, White’s position holds so many weaknesses that he had better start thinking about how he is going to draw; to that end, his rook should have been sent in by 24.Rd4, and if then 24...Bb4, 25.Rxc4 Bxc3 26.R1xc3 Qxc3 27.Rxc3 Rxc3 28.h3.
24...Rc6
25.Nxc4 ...
Extremely dangerous, for now White’s knights both go straight under the gun. One gets away with it, but the other...
25...Qc7
26.Na4 ...
The active 26.Nd5 was not good, since after 26...Nxd5 27.Rxd5 Bf6 etc., there does not seem to be any way to Relieve the pin. What was required was 26.Nb1, when at least one knight would be safe; if then 26...Rc8 27.Nbd2 Bb4 28.Rb1 Nd5 29.Rxb4, with some chances to draw. But now the two hanging knights give rise to a combination which wins a piece.
26...Rc8
27.Rd4 ...
Szabo goes overboard in his desperate attempt to hold the extra pawn, leaving the queen’s rook thus undefended: 27.Nab6 would have left him some small drawing chances.
This position illustrates the power of the pin, based on the unprotected rook at c1.
27...Ne8
The point of this pretty move is easily seen: Black brings this knight to d6, freeing the square f6 for the bishop. From there, the bishop will attack, not only the rook at d4, but also the knight, if it should move from a4 to b2. 27...Nd7 would have been an error, in view of 28.Rc2! Ne5 (the knight blocks the diagonal of the bishop, giving White time to defend) 29.Nab2, and the rook on c2 sidesteps to the d-file; on 28...Bf6 29.Rxd7? would be a mistake, owing to 29...Qxd7 30.Nab6 Qb7 (29.Re4 would be the correct move in that case).
28.e4 Bf6
29.e5 Bxe5
30.Re4 Nf6
Driving the rook from the fourth rank wins Black a piece, since after 31.Rxe5 Rxc4 32.Rxc4 Qxc4 attacks the queen and the knight and threatens mate, too; on 33.Qd1 Black calmly “sacrifices” his queen with 33...Qxa4; or if 33.Qxc4 Rxc4.
31.Nab6 Rxb6

WHITE RESIGNED
58. Euwe—Najdorf
(King’s Indian)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 g6
3.g3 Bg7
4.Bg2 0-0
5.Nc3 c5
6.d5 e5
7.Bg5 h6
Aggressive treatment of the opening. If Black wants to break the pin, he must do it at once, as otherwise White will put his queen on d2, rendering ...h7-h6 impracticable. And if the pin is not broken, then White will move his bishop to h6 and without further ado push his h-pawn — a serious, though hard1y a fatal, threat. From a pure1y chessic viewpoint, then, the logical move was certainly 7...d6.
8.Bf6 Qxf6
9.d6 ...
This pawn sortie combines two strategic ideas: restraint of Black’s queenside development, and cutting the communications between the two wings of Black’s position. Additionally, White gains the valuable square d5 for both bishop and knight.
Black’s retarded development is due chiefly to the fact that the pawn which is now nailed to d7 closes the diagonal c8-h3, which means that the bishop now can only get into play on b7 or a6. But 9...b6 is not yet playable; first the knight must be played to c6. Thus, we can deduce that Black’s next three moves will be: 9...Nc6, 10...b6, and 11...Bb7.
Black’s queenside pieces can only reach the kingside by way of the square d8, which puts quite a crimp on their maneuverability.
These are the positive aspects of 9.d6. There is only one negative aspect: cut off from support, this pawn may die. White’s task is therefore to assail the kingside with might and main for as long as the pawn at d6 stands, depriving Black’s kingside of the necessary support of his queen-side pieces. This task Euwe carries out in brilliant style.
9...Nc6
10.e3 b6
11.Bd5 Kh8
In order to prepare ...f7-f5. In his later commentary, Najdorf suggested a different plan: 11...Ba6, 12...Rb8, and 13...b5. It seems to me, however, that in that event the kingside attack would have developed more quickly and more dangerously.
12.Ne4 Qd8
13.h4! f5
14.Ng5
We would like to draw the reader’s attention to this elegant knight leap; we did not give it an exclamation mark, simply because we had already given one to White’s previous move.
14...Bb7
Naturally, Black doesn’t even think of saving the exchange, nor would White dream of taking it: after 15.Nf7+ Rxf7 16.Bxf7 Nb4 the initiative would pass to Black.
15.g4 ...
White continues methodically clearing the approaches to the black king. On 15...Na5, White could trade bishops (16.Bxb7 Nxb7) and play his queen to d5 (17.Qd5), with two threats: 18.Qxb7 and 18.Nf7+; and on 15...Qf6, White has the choice between 16.Nf7+, attacking the queen and winning the exchange after 16...Rxf7 17.g5, or 16.gxf5 Qxf5 17.Rh2.
15...e4
Black is not opening the h8-a1 diagonal in order to capture the -b-pawn, but in order to allow his king to hie himself to g7, after which perhaps Black could risk capturing the knight. But now a white knight gets to f4.
16.Ne2 Bxb2
17.Nf4 ...
White, in turn, also sacrifices the exchange. Couldn’t Black take it? That question cannot be answered with variations. White has a myriad of appealing attacking continuations. To examine one: 17...Bxa1 18.gxf5 Bc3+ 19.Kf1 is similar to what actually occurred; and it would seem to me that White’s threats — 20.Nxg6+, 20.Qg4, etc. — would be impossible to withstand, especially under tournament conditions. Najdorf was apparently of the same opinion: before anything else, he aims to shore up the key point g6. (A note here: White’s attack would congeal very quickly if he limited his sacrifice to the exchange: 18.Qxa1+? Qf6 19.Nxg6+ Kg7.)
17...Qf6
18.gxf5! Bxa1
Since White must attain one of the important squares (g6, h6 or h5) in any event, Najdorf decides to take the rook after all, since this might later allow him to give up his queen for two pieces or a piece and a pawn. On 18...gxf5, White would have continued 19.Rb1 Be5 20.Qh5, with a tremendous attack. The next phase of the game puts one in mind of those ancient clashes of the masters of the Italian School.
19.Nxg6+ Kg7
20.Nxe4 ...
White is practically advertising that his attack is intuitive, rather than calculated — otherwise, why would he need the e-pawn? The simple 20.Nf4, setting up such fearsome threats as 21.Nh5+, 21.Qh5 and 21.Rg1, seems more appealing, yet Euwe didn’t play it. Why? To put it simply, Euwe did not want to give his opponent a choice. White’s 20.Nxe4 forces matters: by depriving Black’s queen of the square c3, it eliminates the variation 20.Nf4 Qc3+ 21.Kf1 — although, in my opinion, this would only improve White’s position. For example: 21...Rxf5 22.Qg4; or 21...hxg5 22.hxg5 Rxf5 23.Rh7+. But —well, Euwe received a brilliancy prize for this game; the judges were not too strict, and we shall not go nitpicking either. Each grandmaster has his own style, with its strengths and weaknesses.
20...Bc3
White has a very strong position, but he is still a whole rook down. 20...Qxf5 was bad: White would have won right off with 21.Qxa1+ Kxg6 22.Rg1+. So first Black pulls his bishop out with check, and then he takes the f-pawn, putting pressure on f2 and removing the protection of the knight at g6.
21.Kf1 Qxf5
22.Nf4 ...
Black needs only another move or two to stabilize his position and escape with his extra rook, but these must be good moves. Thus, 22...Be5 would be answered by 23.Ng3 Qh7 24.Qg4+ Kh8 25.Ng6+; if the queen goes to e5 (22...Qe5) instead, White’s queen checks at g4 (23.Qg4+); and if the bishop retreats to f6 (22...Bf6), then either 23.Ng3 or 23.Rg1+ wins. I believe that Black must lose here even with the best defense. (Had he wished, White could have forced a draw with 22.Rg1, after which Black must play 22...Qh3+ 23.Rg2 Qh1+ 24.Rg1 Qh3+, etc.)
22...Kh8!
This is a good move. White must take the bishop now, giving his opponent a breath of air, since the consequences of 23.Rg1 are unclear.
23.Nxc3 Rae8
But instead of this move, 23...Nd8 was necessary: the bishop on d5 was long past enduring. Variations like 24.Bxb7 Nxb7 25.Nce2 Qe4 26.Rg1 Rg8, or 26.Ng3 Qxc4+ 27.Kg2 Rxf4 would have made it very difficult for White, but I believe he might still have turned the trick with 25.Ncd5! in the first variation, instead of the somewhat flaccid 25.Nce2. The pawn on d6 can be let go now, since it has already done its work. Beyond a doubt, however, Euwe’s 20.Nxe4 put a damper on his attack, whereas Najdorf in turn failed to capitalize on his good fortune.
24.Nce2 Rg8
25.h5 Rg5
26.Ng3 Rxg3
Unpleasant, but forced: on 26...Qg4 there would follow 27.Bf3, and any other retreat gives White far too many pleasant possibilities. At least 26...Rxg3 does not hand over the initiative.
27.fxg3 Rxe3
28.Kf2 ...
There has been no mate as yet, and the material is still even, but the bishop on b7 and the knight on c6 are still mere bystanders; it is this last circumstance that allows White the opportunity to re-form his troops into a new attacking wave and send them in once again to assault the black king’s broken position.
28...Re8
29.Re1 Rxe1
30.Qxe1 Kg7
31.Qe8 ...
The poorly sheltered king is a good target, both in the middlegame and in the endgame.
31...Qc2+
32.Kg1 Qd1+
33.Kh2 Qc2+
34.Ng2 Qf5
35.Qg8+ Kf6
36.Qh8+ Kg5
37.Qg7+
BLACK RESIGNED,
as mate is inevitable.
59. Stahlberg—Taimanov
(Queen’s Indian Defense)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6
3.Nf3 b6
4.g3 Ba6
Modern thinking in the opening. The move ...b7-b6 does not necessarily mean that Black intends to continue with ...Bb7. He may also attack the pawn at c4; and although there are no less than eleven different defenses to this, each method has its drawbacks. White selects what seems to be the best line.
5.Qa4 ...
To this I would eagerly have replied 5...c5, exploiting the fact that with the queen off-sides, 6.d5 is no longer possible; if 6.Bg2, then 6...Bb7. As the course of the game will show, Taimanov has other ideas for this pawn.
5...Be7
6.Bg2 0-0
7.Nc3 c6
8.Ne5 ...
8.Bf4! probably looked too primitive to White, but in that case Taimanov would have had nothing better than 8...Qc8 or 8...Bb7, since the complications after 8...b5 would inevitably resolve in White’s favor.
8...Qe8
9.0-0 d5
10.Re1 ...
White no longer has any advantage. The text move prepares e2-e4, which he never gets the chance to play. Like it or not, he ought to have continued 10.cxd5 cxd5 11.Qxe8 and 12.Re1, with an approximately equal game.
10...b5
Black seizes the initiative.
11.cxb5 cxb5
12.Qd1 b4
13.Nb1 ...
Obsessed by his desire to play e2-e4 at any cost, White now drops this knight completely out of sight, so as to redevelop it to d2. Doubtless, a4 (with the prospect of getting to c5) would have been a little better square.
13...Nc6
14.Nxc6 Qxc6
15.Nd2 Qb6
16.e3 ...
Stahlberg does not seem to have been in a mood to play chess this evening: 16.Nb3 would have left him with some chances of putting together a defense.
16...Rac8
17.Bf1 Rc6
18.Bxa6 Qxa6
19.Nf3 Rfc8
20.Qb3 Ne4
21.Nd2 Rc2
An instructive position which shows us:
1) why, when only one bishop remains, we are told to place our pawns on squares of opposite color. This gives the bishop pawn-trenches to traverse: for example, if White had the light-squared bishop, he would have a fully acceptable game, whereas here his position is hopeless.
2) why it is so clearly advantageous to trade off the enemy’s fianchettoed bishop: the square g2 is very weak, and the usual technique of queen to f3, followed by pawn to h5-h4-h3 promises a swift end for White.
3) the importance of seizing the seventh (or second) rank, or even a single square of it. Black could have won two pieces for a rook here with 21...Rxc1 22.Raxc1 Nxd2, but instead, he simply placed his rook on c2. On the second rank, the rook restricts the enemy pieces, and also sets up sundry combinations, as we shall observe later on.
22.Nxe4 e4
23.a3 ...
Black could have wound the game up here by 23...Qd3 24.Qxd3 exd3. This threatens to win the bishop, which has yet to make a single move; and if 25.Rd1, then 25...Re2, when the pawn cannot be taken (26.Rxd3) because of 26...Re1+, winning the unfortunate bishop. If White, in reply to 23...Qd3, avoids the exchange of queens by playing 24.Qa4, the simple 24...b3 underscores his utter helplessness: for example, 25.Qxa7 Bf8 26.a4 Re2 27.Rf1 Rcc2 28.a5 Rxf2 29.Rxf2 Qd1+ 30.Kg2 Qf3+. However, the text is not a bad idea either.
23...h5
24.d5 R8c4
Now White cannot take the e-pawn, since Black’s queen would recapture and enter f3 via f6; then, after ...h5-h4, White would have to resign. If, after 25.dxe6 Qxe6, White took the b-pawn (26.axb4), then 26...Rxc1 27.Raxc1 Rxc1 28.Qxe6 Rxe1+.
25.Rd1 exd5
26.Bd2 Qf6
27.Rab1 h4
28.Qa4 Qf5
29.Qxa7 Bf8
This chance to exchange queens amounts to a reprieve for White. 29...Bg5 would have deprived him of this chance, and then nothing could have saved him from ...h4-h3 followed by ...Qf3.
30.Qb8 g5
31.gxh4 h4
32.Qf4 Qxf4
33.exf4 d4
34.b3 Rc6
35.axb4 f5
Taimanov has managed to drag it out a bit, but White’s game is very bad, still: he has five isolated pawns, and Black’s rook at c2 in conjunction with his passed pawn assures him the victory.

10.f4 h6
11.Bh4 Qa5
12.e5 dxe5
13.Qxe5 b6
A strange optical illusion! Theory holds that the exchange of queens leads by force to a favorable endgame for White, while retreating his queen to b6 (13...Qb6) is bad because of 14.Na4 Qc6 15.Bb5 Qxg2 16.Rhg1. This is all true, but only with the black pawn at h7! Then, indeed, after
(to the line)
13...Qxe5 14.fxe5 Nd5 15.Bxe7 Nxe7 16.Bd3, Black could not play 16...Bd7 because of 17.Bxh7+ Kxh7 18.Rxd7; Black would have to continue 16...Nc6 17.Rhe1, when 17...Bd7 is once more impossible, and White establishes a bind. In the present game, however, with the pawn on h6 (13...Qxe5 14.fxe5 Nd5 15.Bxe7 Nxe7 16.Bd3), 16...Bd7 is quite possible: after 17.Bh7+ Kxh7 18.Rxd7 Nc6, the exchange of b-pawn for e-pawn is not dangerous to Black, as long as White is no great endgame enthusiast — which Boleslavsky is not.
Both players overlooked this, and Gligoric played the novelty he had prepared for the other variation.
14.Qxa5 bxa5
Black believes the free game he gets for his bishops and rooks compensates for his doubled, isolated pawns; but in my opinion, White must have the better of it. He has a 3/2 pawn majority, without the need to create a passed pawn from it: the passed pawn is already made for him! The closer the endgame approaches, the more the c-pawn’s presence will be felt.
15.Bd3 Bb7
16.Rhg1 Rfe8
16...Bc5 would give Black nothing, since after 17.Rge1, the pawn on g2 would still be taboo: 17.Rge1 Bxg2? 18.Bxf6 gxf6 19.Rg1, winning the pair of bishops for the rook. Nor is 16...Bc5 17.Rge1 Nd5 attractive, since simplifications are generally unfavorable to Black here; and besides, White would stand a great deal better after 18.Nxd5 Bxd5 19.Be4 Bxe4 20.Rxe4.
17.h3 ...
White readies 18.g4, which does not work right away (17.g4) because of 17...Bc5 and 18...Nxg4.
17...Bc5
18.Rge1 Bb4
Taking on g2 would still be bad. Perhaps moving the king to h8 would have been a more useful 16th move: Boleslavsky played it himself in a later tournament.
19.f5 ...
Without fearing 19...Bxc3, which would give White a passed pawn on the c-file. This observation might come as a surprise to the reader, since White already has a passed pawn on c2. Unfortunately for White, this pawn cannot be considered passed with so many pieces still on the board, since it may not stir a sing1e step without upsetting the king’s disposition. If, however, Black were to take the knight here, then the c3-pawn, supported by the bishop pair, could run for daylight, while the c2-pawn remained behind to shelter the king.
19...e5
If Black was not happy with the 19...exf5 variation, then 19...Nd5 was the obvious continuation in order to play on the pin. This move costs Black his last point of support in the center, and the passed e-pawn is no compensation.
20.Bb5 Re7
21.Re3 a6
22.Ba4 Bc5
The pawn at g2 has been indirectly defended all this time by the black king’s location on the g-file (...Bxg2; Bxf6! gxf6; Rg1, pinning the bishop); had the king gone to f8 here (22...Kf8), there might have followed 23.a3 Bxc3 24.Rxc3 Bxg2 25.Rg3 and 26.Rdg1, and now it is Black who finds his g-pawn hard to protect. However, the text move also says that Gligoric is unable to find a plan to improve his position. Meanwhile, Boleslavsky proceeds, in the straightforward style characteristic of him, to engineer a minor-piece trade, seize control of d5, and force the further advance (and further weakening) of the e-pawn.

The four-rook endgame makes White’s advantage very clear.
Black’s rooks ride quietly at anchor, defending their passed pawn; but White’s king stands co near that it may easily get next to the pawn, let’s say to f3. Should the e-pawn fall, then white’s win will become a matter of time. Black’s king can neither come to the aid of its pawn, nor counterattack the f-pawn. A further demonstration of white’s possibilities is that, were it his move here, then 32.c4, followed by 33.Rc3, would leave Black in a completely hopeless predicament, with the rook on c3 simultaneously attacking the pawn on e3 and supporting its own passed pawn. Black’s next move is directed against this threat.
31...Re4
32.c3 Kg7

34.g4 h5
35.Rd6 ...
Tying the king down to the f6-pawn —
35...g4
36.g4 Kh6
— but the black king refuses to be tied down! Black is giving up both his f-pawns in order to reach the square f3, which will secure him the draw. Might this possibility have been prevented? Yes; the mistake was 34.g4, by which White transferred the base of his pawn chain from g2 to g4 — i.e., closer to Black’s king. He ought to have played 34.g3, with excellent winning chances: for instance, 34.g3 Rxf5 35.Rdxe3 Rxe3 36.Rxe3 a4 37.c4 Rf2+ 38.Kc3 a3 39.bxa3 Rxa2 40.Kb4. In this line, the winning idea is not the capture of the e-pawn, but the exchange of one pair of rooks in order to secure maximum activity for his other pieces.
After 34.g4 h5, White no longer has any advantage from either 35.Rd4 or 35.c4: for example, 35.Rd4 Kh6 36.Kd3 Kg5 37.c4 hxg4 38.hxg4 Kh4.
37.Rxf6+ Kg5
38.Rxf7 Kxg4
39.Rd7 Kf3
Black’s king has achieved a stunning success, becoming the first to break into the enemy position.
40.Kd3 ...
Luckily, White still has this move: if not, Black would have won
40...Rf5
41.c4 a4
42.Rd6
DRAW
— after intensive analysis.
White must move his rook back and forth along the d-file. After 42.c5, he would lose, and most instructively. White’s king must defend the rook on e2 and the pawn on c4 at the same time; the latter pawn protects the supremely important support point at d5 for the rook, thus defending the king against checks on the d-file. 42.c5 would allow Black to double his rooks on the fifth rank and drive off the white king, thus: 42...Ree5 43.c6 Rd5+ 44.Kc4 Rc5+ 45.Kd3 Rfd5+ 46.Rxd5 Rxd5+ 47.Kc4 Rd2, and Black wins. There are many other combinative possibilities in this ending after 42.c5?, and all of them favor Black; but as long as the pawn stands at c4, the king at d3, and the rook covers the d-file, White can hold the draw.
61. Kotov—Bronstein
(King’s Indian)
Everyone loves to attack the king, but it is often hard to decide on such an attack, especially when one’s opponent can counterattack on the opposite wing. The problem is that although the goal of the kingside attack — mate to the enemy’s king — is more enticing, it is also far more difficult to achieve than, for example, the creation of a few pawn weaknesses by means of a queenside attack. An attack on the king with pieces alone requires overwhelming numerical superiority and generally a few sacrifices; and the pawns cannot always join in the assault. The present game is an example of headlong opposite-wing counterattacking. Watch how each side persistently prevents the other’s pawn breaks, c4-c5 and ...f7-f5. Kotov is the first to achieve his goal, and his powerful passed pawn at full career very nearly overpowers the massed striking force of the entire black army.

Usually 9...Nc5 is played, and then 10...a5. For this game, Black has selected a different approach, which does not especially require the presence of a knight on c5; thus there is no need to move the pawn to a5. The text move is played mainly to secure the square b5; in conjunction with Black’s following move, it may also support a queenside pawn advance.

Unhackneyed play. White does not place his knight on d3, where it could have supported the break c4-c5, but on e3, where it helps the queen offer maximum resistance to Black’s break ...f7-f5. The ensuing lengthy war of maneuver centers about these two strategically important advances.

Having set up a new defensive line on the c8-a6 diagonal (bishop, pawn and rook), Black throws all his other pieces to the kingside. He might have frozen the c-pawn with 24...Nc5 but was loath to give up this knight, which is destined to play a lead role in the forthcoming attack. However, ...Nc5 was the correct move, as it would have left Black with a very solid game.
25.c5 Ng5
26.Qc4 Bh6

Black is forced to rush his attack, as once the white rook gets to b’, Black’s position becomes quite uncertain.
33.Bxh3 Bxh3
34.Ng4 ...
If White naively picks off the b-pawn, Black penetrates to the king by means of a knight sacrifice on g3: 34.Qxb7 Nxg3 35.fxg3 Bxe3+ 36.Bxe3 Qf1+ 37.Kh2, and now Black has the choice between 37...Kg7, to clear h8 for the rook, or 37...Rab8 38.Qc6 Rfc8. 34.Rab1 would not have eliminated the threat of ...Nxg3; Kotov’s move was best.
34...Bxg4
35.Bxh6 Rfc8
36.Qxb7 ...
36...Rcb8
Thus, White is the first to reach his goal: he has annexed the weak b-pawn. But now his bishop is trapped.
37.a6 g5
By now it was time for Black to give up thinking about winning the bishop, and concentrate on securing the a-pawn instead, which grows more dangerous with each move. 37...Rxb7 38.axb7 Rb8 39.Ra8 Qd8 40.Rc8! Rxc8 41.Rxc8 Qxc8 42.bxc8=Q+ Bxc8 would have led to a clear draw; now, however, things get much more complex.
38.Qxb8+ ...
Black’s previous error now allows a beautiful, though far from obvious, combination, reminiscent of a study. A quiet move, 38.Rcb1, is the prelude, with the main variation running: 38...Rxb7 39.axb7 Rb8 40.Ra8 Qd8 41.Bxg5 f6 42.Rxb8 Qxb8 43.Be3 Bc8 44.Ba7 Qxb7 45.Rxb7 Bxb7, and now White wins easily with 46.Bb8, attacking the black pawns from behind. Black would have to continue 38...Re8 in order to avoid the main variation; on 39.a7, he would have had to retreat his king to h7, as in the game, but this would have left White an important tempo ahead, which he could utilize by playing 40.Qc6, attacking both rooks and threatening to capture either one, depending upon Black’s reply. This would have made matters much more pleasant for White than they turned out in the game.
38...Rxb8
39.a7 Ra8
40.Rcb1 Kh7
The winning move: the king avoids the eighth-rank check, and Black gets queen and minor piece for two rooks (Black could also have transposed with 40...Rxa7 41.Rb8+ Kh7).
41.Rb8 Rxa7
42.Rxa7 Kxh6
43.Rbb7 Kg6
44.f3 Bc8
45.Rc7 Qd8
The simplest way for Black to win is to break through to the king with his queen. This can be accomplished in either of two ways: by a piece sacrifice, or by a flanking maneuver via d8 and b8; Black chooses the latter. A move earlier, he could also have played 44...Nxg3, but after 45.Rxf7 Qxf7 46.Rxf7 Kxf7 47.fxg4 Nxe4 48.Nc2 Nf6 49.Ne3, a knight endgame is reached in which Black has an extra pawn, but White has some drawing chances.

47.Kg2 Bd7
48.Nc2 Bxg4
There’s no other way but to sacrifice.

White can’t keep the queen out of b6: if he fails to capture the f-pawn, the queen invades via f6.

55.Ne3 Qd3
This was the next-to-last move before the second time control. Black would have had enough to win with after 55...Kg5 56.Rcg7+ Kf4 57.Ng2+ Kxe4 58.Rxh6 g3+, or 58...Qf3+. Unfortunately, he gave up his knight too late.

1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6
3.Nf3 d5
4.Nc3 c5
5.cxd5 Nxd5
6.e3 Nc6
7.Bd3 ...
White had a choice between 7.Bd3 and 7.Bc4. The former, aiming at quick development and a piece attack on the kingside, was in vogue twenty or thirty years ago, up until a game between Botvinnik and Alekhine, in which White played 7.Bc4 and won a beautiful endgame. With 7.Bc4 White emphasizes that although the black knight on d5 can consider itself safe from pawns after the exchange on d4, it is not safe from pieces, which means it’s not so well placed on d5, after all.
However, the game Kotov-Leven-fish (16th USSR Championship, Moscow 1948) showed an antidote to 7.Bc4 as well: Black immediately retreated his knight to b6, and stubbornly refused to play ...c5xd4, which would have allowed White to open the diagonal c1-h6 for his bishop with the recapture e3xd4 (this was the mistake Kotov made in his game with Boleslavsky). And, since White’s bishop remained on b3, he could not play b2-b3, so that his queen’s bishop remained a constant source of worry. At the present time, 7.Bd3 and 7.Bc4 enjoy approximately equal reputations.
7...cxd4
8.d4 g6
Reshevsky possesses a unique style, concrete and unprejudiced. Undeterred by the gaping holes he creates at f6 and h6, he closes off the dangerous diagonal b1-h7, and prepares pressure on the pawn at d4. Still, not every player could allow himself such a style, and not every player would enjoy it so. I shall note right here that, despite the draw Reshevsky obtained in this game, he appears to have been dissatisfied with the opening, since in the second half, against Szabo, he exchanged knights on c3 in this position, and then developed his bishop to e7. A few moves later, however, he played ...g7-g6 again. Since Reshevsky did not employ this variation a third time, it would seem that the opening of the second game was still less to his liking.
9.Bg5 Qa5
Geller would undoubtedly have answered 9...Be7 with 10.h4.
10.0-0 ...
The sacrifice of a pawn after a knight exchange on c3 is known from many openings, especially the Greco Attack of the Giuoco Piano, which so delights the beginner. In the present instance, taking the c-pawn with his queen (10...Nxc3 11.bxc3 Qxc3) would soon have left Black hopelessly placed after 12.Bf6.
10...Bg7
11.Ne4 ...
Geller skillfully masks his true intentions: he would seem to be threatening 12.Nd6+, when in reality the knight is heading for f6. Naturally, before this point can be secured, he will have to deal with the knight on d5 and the bishop on g7.
11...0-0
12.Bc4 Qb6
Reshevsky plows unswerving1y on with his plan of attacking the isolated d-pawn (this was the other idea behind 8...g6: to allow the bishop to develop to g7); however, no other player I know of would have allowed White his next two moves. Courage alone is insufficient for such a decision.
13.Bxd5 exd5
14.Nf6+ Bxf6
Why didn’t the king walk out of the check? (14...Kh8) Possibly because of 15.Qd2, or the more forcing 15.Nxd5 Qxb2 16.Bf6; more probably because Black had already planned his 14...Bxf6 and 15...Na5.
15.Bxf6 Na5
It is necessary to ascertain the bishop’s intentions: Black cannot afford to leave it onf6. There is no time to trade off White’s knight, since if 15...Bg4 16.Qd2 Bxf3? 17.Qh6 wins.
16.Be7 ...
Many would have played 16.Qd2 here, forcing Black to accept a slightly inferior ending after 16...Qxf6 17.Qxa5; but as long as Geller can attack, he will do so. After 16.Qd2 Re8 is one of the insufficient replies, in view of 17.Be5, and if 17...Nc4, then 18.Qh6, and now both 18...Nxe5 and 18...f6 would be met by 19.Ng5. I would have preferred 16.Bg5, intending to re-position the bishop at h6: a bishop on that square not infrequently gives rise to some surprising combinations.
16...Re8
17.Bc5 ...
17.Re1, with the same idea of playing Qd1-d2-h6, would have been much more interesting: had Reshevsky then taken the pawn at b2 (17...Qxb2), White would have the pretty reply 18.Bb4, and after 18...Rxe1+ Qxe1, Black loses the knight on a5 in view of the threatened Qe8+.
17...Qxb2

DRAW
— most unexpectedly.
White, of course, would have risked nothing by continuing his fight for the initiative. His pawn minus would have been virtually meaning1ess, in view of Black’s insecure king.
White had several tempting continuations at his disposal: for instance, I like playing the knight to e5 when the black queen is on c3. Also good is the simple 19.Bb4 Qc7 20.Bxa5! Qxa5 21.Qc1, with fierce pressure. If he wanted to force a draw, White could always have done so later. At any rate, Black should have had to work a little for it.

10.Nc3 ...
A theoretical position which occurs often in tournament play; for example, Smyslov-Keres, Budapest 1950. Having put off castling for so long, Black ought to exercise his patience a little longer in order to remove his queen from its dangerous opposition to the white rook, to c7 or b6. With 10...Be7 and 11...b4, Black enters a line which theory rightly considers inferior for Black. On more than one occasion, Keres has overthrown accepted opinion, infusing new ideas into old variations: as examples, take his games with Boleslavsky and Stahlberg from this tournament. Here, however, he plays a variation of low repute without having any improvement prepared, and his heedlessness lands him in immediate difficulties.
(to the line)
10...Be7

Of course! The knight has nowhere to go, so Black must enter a line which leads by force to the creation of a powerful white passed pawn.

16.Nd2 ...
Beginning with this move, Smyslov carries out one idea with iron determination and logic: the minor pieces must clear a path for the passed pawn. The knight and the pair of bishops do not defend the pawn; instead, they attack the squares directly in front of it. Seen in this light, the idea behind the move 16.Nd2 becomes clear: White intends to post this knight on e4 or c4, attacking the square d6.
As the further course of the game shows, it was here that Keres realized the enormity of his error; for the remainder of the game, he displayed amazing resourcefulness, doing literally everything possible to prevent White from capitalizing on his passed pawn.
16...Be7
17.Nc4 a5
18.Nxe5 Nxe5
19.Qxe5 Bf6
20.Qg3 c4
21.Ba4 Qe7
Black’s pawn sacrifice would appear to have achieved something: White now finds it difficult to complete the development of his queenside, since any move of the queen’s bishop (except to b2 or g5, naturally) allows 22...Qa3, winning back the c-pawn.
22.Bf4 ...
Anyway! This is a typical Smyslov move, combining the logical completion of his idea with accurate calculation of its tactical consequences. White disregards his c-pawn in order to secure the forced march of his d-pawn. We should like to draw the reader’s attention to the placement of White’s bishops, laying down a crossfire in front of the pawn.
On 22...Qa3, White achieves a decisive advantage in the following manner: 23.Bc6 Bxc6 24.dxc6 Qxc3 25.Qxc3 Bxc3 26.Rac1 and 27.Rxc4.
22...Rfd8

Now the rook also attacks a square in front of the pawn.
26...Kh7

The battle is lost. Black can no longer withstand the pressure of White’s pieces pushing the pawn forward to queen, and gives up the exchange. The rest is a matter of simple technique.

BLACK RESIGNED
(back to the text)
This is all true, but only with the black pawn at h7! Then, indeed, after 13...Qxe5 14.fxe5 Nd5 15.Bxe7 Nxe7 16.Bd3, Black could not play 16...Bd7 because of 17.Bxh7+ Kxh7 18.Rxd7; Black would have to continue 16...Nc6 17.Rhe1, when 17...Bd7 is once more impossible, and White establishes a bind.

An original decision. Smyslov brings his queen into play, creating long-diagonal pressure which curtails his opponent’s activity somewhat. After 10...Nxd5 there would be no sense for White in winning a pawn with 11.Nxd5 Bxd2 12.Nxb6, since Black’s position would be not one bit inferior after 12...Qxb6 13.Qxd2 Bxf3 14.gxf3 Nc6 15.Be4 Rfd8 16.Bxc6 Qxc6. However, White could continue 11.Qe2, followed by 12.Qe4, when Black would have nothing better than to return his knight to f6.
11.bxc3 Qxd5 12.Re1 Nbd7 13.Qe2 Qh5 14.a4 a6 15.Reb1 Rfd8 16.Be3
Allowing Black to exchange bishops, which vaporizes White’s initiative. However, 16.c4 also leads nowhere, in view of 16...Bxf3 17.Qxf3 Qxf3 18.gxf3 Ne5. White might have played 15.c4, though; at least, he would have kept his two bishops.

A new idea, and not a very good one, either. Keres often uses the deployment Qd3, Be2, Rd1, 0-0, and later even a voluntary Bg5-c1. This game works out rather like that, but with White having spent an extra tempo (g2-g3) on his king’s bishop’s development. Note how smoothly Black’s development proceeds now. One cannot afford to ignore the time element even in the quietest opening — how much more so in the Sicilian!

14.g4
What is wrong with White’s position? His c-pawn is dead; his queen’s knight is just waiting passively for the stroke of a pawn from b4; having a 3/2 queenside pawn majority, White cannot make use of it, and is reduced to playing with his king-side pawns (which explains why systems involving long castling are so popular against the Sicilian: the pawns go precisely where they are needed). Passive play would soon involve White in difficulties, so he sacrifices a pawn for the sake of the initiative: for example, 14...Nxg4 15.Qg3 h5 16.Kh1, when the center of gravity has shifted to the kingside. This variation was easy to accept; however, I also had to be ready for the sharp counterattack Black actually undertook on the queenside.
14...b5
Compare this with a similar move of Geller’s, made in his game with Boleslavsky; then, as now, Black had no time for the pre1iminary 14...a6.

With the white king’s bishop fianchettoed and the black e-pawn advanced to e5 in this variation, the moves 5...a6 and 8...b5 are not intended as part of a queenside attack (since there’s nothing there to attack), but rather to gain space for the black pieces: ...Bb7 and ...Nb8-d7-b6. From this point of view, the bishop’s deployment at e6 makes little sense. The bishop later takes off for g4, and then h5, as if reproaching Kotov for making it idle aimlessly about the board, instead of taking up its station immediately on the long diagonal.
The ...b7-b5-b4 push makes sense only when Black has a pawn at e6 and White’s knight is left without a good retreat. But here, ...b5-b4 will send the knight to the excellent square d5, where Black will be practically forced to trade it off, extending the diagonal of the fianchettoed white king’s bishop. These are all the drawbacks of developing the bishop at e6.

One general rule of chess strategy holds that a target point should be surrounded or isolated before it is attacked. 13.a5 would have been good here, but Gligoric is strong1y opposed to pushing pawns; he will decide to play a4-a5 only several rounds later, in Game 120 against Najdorf.
13...a5
14.c3 bxc3
15.Bxc3 Qb6
White has an extra queenside pawn, but making a passed pawn with it would appear to be the last thing on his mind; he wants to do only what is necessary on the queenside in order to free himself to proceed with his attack on the kingside. This was the aim of the operation: 13.Bd2, 14.c3, and 15.Bxc3. Black must play very alertly in this situation — which he does, in fact, postponing castling until move 20 in order to blunt his opponent’s initiative.
16.h3 Bh5
The further course of the game will give rise to the natural question: shouldn’t he have taken the knight immediately? Probably not. After 16...Bxe2 17.Qxe2 Be7, White, with the two bishops already in hand, would have had no reason to undertake any sort of kingside operation. It would be a good idea then to remember his a-pawn and prepare b2-b4 to make it a passed one.
17.Kh2 Be7
White has secured a definite advantage, and has made all of his preparatory moves; now the time has come to solve the main problem of which road to choose in order to get to the win.
Sometimes it’s enough mere1y to play the so-called “reasonable” and “natural” moves: occupy the open files with your rooks, move them to the seventh rank, pile up on a backward pawn, create a protected passed pawn and queen it... Many a game has been won just that automatically: “By means of simple/logical/obvious moves, White converts his advantage into a win”; “White’s attack plays itself” — we have all read such formulas more than once. However, today’s high level of defensive technique makes it difficult to believe that a game will, like a good horse, bring its player to the desired end by itself. When one plays an experienced master, who knows all of the defensive tricks, sometimes the road to victory is a narrow path of precise moves.
Gligoric should have converted his accumulated advantages into a direct attack, beginning with 18.g4, kicking back the unfortunate bishop before anything else; after 18...Bg6 19.f4 would have been considerably stronger. The threat of 20.f5 would have forced 19...f6; then there would follow 20.f5 Bf7 21.Ng3, intending 22.Qf3 and 23.h4, etc. This would lead to a sharp game, admittedly with some risk to White, whose king would not be left all that well protected; but certainly he would also have been left with most of the chances. The halfhearted plan White actually selects sends his game down a blind alley.
18.f4 Bxe2
At last, this bishop goes from words to action, removing the last of White’s knights.
19.Qxe2 Bf6
20.Qc4 ...
After 18.f4, the plan of creating a passed a-pawn lost much of its punch, since the ever-present threat of ...exf4 prevents White from devoting sufficient attention to the queen’s wing. Here a combinative player would certainly have permitted himself 20.g4, threatening 21.g5, 22.Qg4, and 23.f5; if then 20...h6 21.h4 is quite possible, and the threat to advance the g-pawn once again forces Black’s king to remain in the center. Taking the h-pawn (21...Bxh4) would not be without risk for Black either, in view of 22.fxe5, opening up the center; in that event, even Black’s best move, 22...0-0, would leave him with a difficult position. White wants to improve the placement of his pieces a bit before embarking upon the pawn storm; but Kotov, as usual, defends supere1y.
20...0-0
21.Qc6 Rfd8
White wanted to make a second use of the same technique for extending his bishop’s scope. For the present, this bishop is shut in behind the pawn; the exchange of queens would give both bishop and pawn a brilliant future. Kotov, naturally, does not take the queen.
22.Rae1 ...
A trap: if 22...exf4 23.Bxf6, ignoring the in-between check 23...fxg3+ 24.Kh1 gxf6 25.Re7, when the threats of 26.Rxd7 and 26.Qxd6 are hard to meet.
22...Qb8
Reculer pour mieux avancer
. A few “natural” moves, and already what was Gligoric’s initiative is passing to Black. White has carved some holes in his own pawn formation, and as soon as Black gets the chance to play ...exf4, forcing the trade of the dark-square bishops, all White’s weaknesses will be laid bare.
23.Rb1 Ra7
24.Qc4 Rc8
25.Qe4 Qb3
The rebound. Black threatens to win a pawn by 26...Rc4, as well as by capturing first on f4 and then on c3. If White meets 26...exf4 by taking the bishop on f6, then Black would be perfectly justified in giving check on g3 before recapturing on f6 with the knight.

30.Rf4 ...
Black’s position is as solid as a cliffwall. In desperation, White sacrifices the exchange, in hopes that his opponent will grow care1ess, or commit some oversight in the complications to follow — although these pose much more of a threat to White than to Black.

Boleslavsky repeats the line Najdorf so successfully employed against Taimanov (cf. Game 28, Round Four), but on this occasion Taimanov eschews 8.d5, attempting instead to gain the upper hand by means of 8.Be3. However, this move is so inoffensive as to place White in the defender’s position. Further investigation of this system has shown that by playing 8...Re8, Black can practically force a whole series of exchanges, thereby solving his defensive problem (cf. Game 107, Reshevsky - Najdorf). When this game was played, that improvement had not yet been discovered. After 8...Ng4 9.Bg5, Black could play 9...Bf6, offering to trade off the dark-square bishops; after the move he actually plays, White carries out a plan which secures him control of d5 and a definite advantage. So Black’s 8...Ng4 maneuver must be considered not wholly satisfactory, inasmuch as he intends to continue with 9...f6; the same 8...Ng4 would be much better if Black played it in conjunction with 9...Bf6.
9.Bg5 f6
10.Bc1 exd4
Sometimes, in positions like this, 10...f5 is not too bad. Boleslavsky selected the text, however, and it is hard to say whether he thought 10...exd4 a better move or simply wished to obtain some variety

13...Kh8
14.Bxg4 fxg4
Now White has removed one of Black’s pawns from the center, at the cost of ceding Black the bishop-pair. White plans to strengthen his position in approximately the following fashion: Bc1-e3-d4, trading bishops, Nd5, and the rooks to d1 and c1 or else to d1 and e1. If he is allowed to carry out all this, sooner or later Black will be forced to advance the c-pawn, after which White can successfully assail the d-pawn.
Black’s counterplay is based, first and foremost, on his bishop-pair, which enable one sometimes to hold a draw even in a pawn-down endgame; and secondly, on the shaky status of the e-pawn, since its defender will have to reckon with the pawn on g4.
Let us watch now as the two plans collide, and what comes of it.
15.Be3 Qf6
16.Rac1 ...
White’s plan requires 16.Rfd1, in order to threaten 17.Bd4, and so as to be able to meet 16...Be6 17.Qxb7 Bxc4 with 18.Qxc7. Black would probably have replied 16...Qf7, when 17.Bd4 Qxd5 18.Nxd5 would have led to something resembling the desired position for White which we were discussing.
18.cxd5 was also possible, with strong pressure on the c-file.
16...Qf7
17.b3 Qxd5
18.Nxd5 Rf7
19.f3 ...
A pretty tactical stroke: on 19...gxf3 20.Rxf3 Rxf3 21.gxf3 c6 22.Nc7 Rb8 23.Bxa7 snares the rook; the same idea also works in the variation 19...a6 20.fxg4 Rxf1+ 21.Rxf1 c6 22.Nc7, etc. And if 21...Bxg4 22.Nxc7 Rc8, Black is already a pawn down, and still saddled with the weakness at d6.
Black therefore hastens to drive the knight out of d5 while his rook is still protecting the c7 square, White’s dream of netting the black queen’s rook vanishes like smoke, and the move 19.f3 turns out to be useless.
It’s almost sinful to criticize a move that leads practically by force to the win of a good pawn, but it would appear that here, too, White might well have held to the positional course with 19.Rfd1, trading bishops on d4 and maintaining a powerful bind.
19...c6
20.Nf4 gxf3
21.gxf3 Bd7
22.Rcd1 Be5
23.Ng2 Re8
Boleslavsky decides to give up the a-pawn in order to secure the trade of his weak d-pawn for White’s center pawn. With Black’s bishop-pair, this accomplishment practically guarantees him the draw.
24.f4 Bc3 25.Rxd6 Rxe4 26.Bxa7 Bg4 27.Rd3 Bf6 28.Re3 Rxe3 29.Nxe3 Bh3 30.Rd1 Be7 31.Ng2 Kg8 32.Be3 Rf8 33.Ne1 Bg4
White’s game is not one bit superior, despite his pawn plus. After the attack on his rook, White ought to have accepted the repetition with Rd1-d3-d1; leaving the d-file puts him into a cramped position.

The opening is chiefly of interest for its history. It saw a lot of use in the Alekhine - Capablanca World Championship match, where most of the games were drawn after some positional sparring; in any event, Black was unable to win even one. Such biteless defenses are out of fashion nowadays. White’s next move (11.Ne4) was an Alekhine invention, to which Capablanca’s usual reply was 11...N5f6. Stahlberg plays an immediate 11...e5, which fails to ease Black’s defense, but does allow White to avoid the exchange of queens he would have to permit with 11...N5f6 12.Ng3 Qb4+.
11.Ne4 e5
12.0-0 ...
Naturally White is not tempted by the win of a pawn: 12.dxe5 Nxe5 13.Bxd5 Nxf3+ 14.gxf3 cxd5 15.Qxd5, since Black would then be able to develop almost all of his remaining pieces with tempo on the white queen. Nor would 12.Bxd5 cxd5 13.Nc3 amount to anything, in view of 13...e4, with a good game for Black (14.Nxd5? Qd6).
12...exd4
13.Qxd4 N7b6
14.Bb3 Bg4
15.Ng3 Bxf3
Here and later, Stahlberg holds to his usual tactic (especially when playing Black) of wholesale exchanges, figuring that this will secure him a draw sooner or later; if any sort of concrete threat a-rises, he trusts his experience and tactical abilities to show him a way out. However, if Stahlberg intended to trade queens, he ought to have left himself the bishop, since the white bishop will be superior to the black knight in any minor-piece ending— though not sufficiently better to forge a win from that factor alone, of course. Since the black bishop will disappear in another half-move (16.gxf3), however, this was not the time to trade queens. 16...Rad8 17.Rfd1 Rfe8 was natural: nothing really threatens Black, and it is quite likely that White would then have tried for the trade of queens himself by, for example, 18.Nf5 Qg5+ 19.Qg4, when Black could play 19...Qxg4+, thereby returning the g-pawn to its original file.

22.Rxd8 Rxd8
23.Rg1 Ne8
A curious picture. Black has absolutely no intention of ever playing ...g7-g6, even though that would re1ieve him of many of his later difficulties. In the succeeding phase of the game, Black saddles himself with a number of weaknesses, advancing nearly every pawn but the one he should have.
24.Rg4 ...
White has gradually accumulated an uncommon store of positional capital: his king is centralized, his rook is on the fourth rank, where it will attack Black’s pawns, the bishop controls important squares, and the knight is actively placed too. As before, Stahlberg re1ies on the inner defensive strength of his position, and on his ability to repel any danger by tactical means, while Najdorf breaks down the black position with a steady alternation of lefts and rights.
24...Ne7
Nor should this exchange of knights be counted an achievement for Black: his one remaining knight cannot hope to pose White any serious threats, while two knights working together might at least have driven the white bishop from b3, thereby easing the pressure on d5, which grows more and more acute with every exchange. So here too, 24...g6 ought to have been played.
25.Nxe7 Kxe7
26.Re4+ Kf8
27.Ra4 a6
28.Rf4 f6
It’s amazing, how nearly right Stahlberg’s rather careless method of play is. This is apparent from the fact that, despite a string of inaccurate, and some just plain bad, moves, Black’s game, positionally speaking, was still not completely lost. True, his choices were already limited: neither 28...Rd7 nor 28...Nd6 was any good, but after 28...Nf6 he could still have held things together. White would have continued in the same fashion, improving his position with e4, f4-f5, then f4 a second time, then a4, and then b4 after the bishop retreats, gradually securing more and more space. (An important peculiarity of this position is that after f4-f5 the square e5 is not weakened, thanks to the presence of a second f-pawn, which prevents Black from establishing his knight on e5.) But this plan would still have met a lot of resistance from his opponent; now, however, 28...f6?, this terrible and completely unnecessary weakening of the e6 square, soon followed by a second, 29...h6 (which weakens g6), considerably eases White’s task.
29.Rh4 h6
30.Rh5 ...
An excellent move! Having done its work on the fourth rank, the rook now goes to the fifth, where it restricts Black’s pawns to complete passivity. White begins to occupy more space by advancing pawns and bringing up his king.

Seeing now that he stands on the very brink of disaster, Black wants to drive off the bishop to give his knight a bit of air, but his decision comes too late.
36.a4 b5
37.Bc2 ...
Why wait until you’re chased? Now he threatens 38.Be4, and the variations 37...c4 38.Be4 Rb6 39.b3!, and 38...Rc5 39.b4 favor White.

3.Bg2 Bf5
4.d3 e6
5.Nbd2 h6
A loss of time. In such positions, it is better to focus one’s attention on piece development, leaving the bishop to fend for itself. If White presses to exchange it off on g6, I believe this can only improve Black’s position.
6.0-0 Bc5
7.Qe1! ...
A fine move, which trains the queen’s fire on both black bishops: now e2-e4 and b2-b4 are both threats. White’s system of development is certainly not as harmless as it might seem to be (cf. the second-half game Smyslov - Euwe).
7...0-0
8.e4 dxe4
9.Nxe4 Nxe4
Black’s last two moves seem inconsistent to me. By his 10th move, Black ought to have come up with some sort of plan. The first question to be decided is whether he is going to retain his queen’s bishop or trade it off. If it is to be traded, then the bishop, not the knight, ought to have taken on e4: it will now be a long time before this bishop can capture anything more substantial than a pawn. And if it is not to be traded (which, to judge from Black’s fifth move, is indeed his intention), then he ought to have retreated it to h7 on the previous move, keeping the pawn tension in the center and restricting the mobility of White’s d- and e-pawns — and even of his c-pawn — somewhat. But if, after 9.Nxe4, the dark-square bishop were to retreat to e7 (9...Be7), then after 10.Nh4! Black would still be forced to part with one of his bishops, since 10...Bh7 would be impossible in view of 11.Nxf6+ and 12.Bxb7.
10.dxe4 Bh7
11.b4 Be7
12.Bb2 Na6
Black’s heedlessness has brought him into difficulties, although they are not yet insuperable. He needs to develop his queen’s knight and to find a good spot for the queen: a task best performed by ...c6, ...Qc7 and ...Nd7. Bringing the knight to c7 looks artificial, and it is difficult even to guess what benefit Dr. Euwe thought he would derive therefrom.
13.a3 c6
14.Rd1 Qc8
15.c4 Nc7
16.Qc3 ...
Now White has a clear advantage. All six of Black’s pieces stand passively, and routine exchanges on the d-file will not ease his situation, since the fewer pieces remain on the board, the more forcefully will the entombed h7-bishop’s absence from the fray be felt. The choice of the plan for the capitalization of White’s advantage is a matter for individual taste ; already, more than one way is possible. One good idea is 16.c5, followed by bringing the knight via c4 to d6.
16...Bf6
17.Ne5 Rd8
18.Bf3 ...
White waits. 18.Qc1, followed by c4-c5, was more active. Why take over an open file, if one is not going to use it to penetrate the enemy position? While the d-file is under White’s control, it ought to be used to get the white knight to d6.
18...Ne8
19.Rxd8 Qxd8
20.Rd1 Qc7
21.c5 a5
Black opens the a-file, and abandons it forthwith: 23...Rd8. If that was what he intended, then the a-pawn would have been better left on a7, keeping the possibility of playing ...b7-b6.
22.Bg2 axb4
23.axb4 Rd8
24.Rxd8 Qxd8
25.Qc2 Nc7
26.Bf1 Nb5
27.f4
White has not maneuvered very energetically, and Black has succeeded in improving the placement of his pieces — without, however, solving his biggest headache: the bishop is as much out of the picture as ever. This makes White caRe1ess; he has completely forgotten to look after his e-pawn, and here was Black’s chance to punish him, Euwe could practically have equalized by 27...Qa8, threatening to invade via a2. So the restrained 26.f3!, instead of 26.Bf1 and 27.f4, was the move to keep the h7-bishop’s horizons limited.
One way to free the bishop from its kingside incarceration would be ...f7-f6 and ...e6-e5, allowing the bishop to exit via g8. It is this plan which Black intends to carry out now, in fact, and White must play actively in order to keep the upper hand. The immediate threat was 27...Nd4, hitting the queen at c2 and cutting off the queen’s bishop from the knight on e5 — this explains White’s last move. Now Black could have brought about a trade of queens with 27...Nd4 28.Qd1 Nb5, as the white queen cannot simultaneously guard the e-pawn and escape from the knight. White would therefore have continued 29.Qxd8+ Bxd8, keeping somewhat the better ending: 30.Bd3 Kf8 31.Kf2 f6 32.Nc4 Ke7 33.Ke3, and not only does Black get no chance to push his e-pawn, he must now worry about whether White will push his. So Black chooses to fight with queens.

This is stronger, in my opinion, than 9...Be7, as Szabo played against Gligoric. Indeed, there can’t be very many opening variations in which Black succeeds in developing all of his minor pieces so quickly, to such active positions!
From here on, the knight on e4 draws battle like a magnet. It appears firmly entrenched at present; if it should chance to be driven away, however, Black’s entire game will totter.
10.Nbd2 ...
After 10.Qd3 Ne7 11.Be3 Bf5!, or simply 10...0-0 11.Be3 f5, Black also stands well.
10...0-0
11.Bc2 f5
An interesting variation, in which the knight is sacrificed at f2, flared, meteor-like, for a moment, and then disappeared. Botvinnik used it against Smyslov in the 1943 Moscow Championship, and a very lively game resulted. Since then, however, no one has come forward who has been willing to repeat the experiment in a game of any importance.
12.Nb3 ...
12.exf6 was also possible; in that event, the recapture on f6 (12...Nxf6) would have forced Black’s knight to leave its outpost at e4, when White could have continued with 13.Nb3 Bb6 14.Nbd4, or 14.Ng5, leading to a game of lively piece play. Averbakh, however, hopes to get more out of the position by retaining the pawn on e5 and driving out the knight with f2-f3. Then, too, 12...Nxf6 is not the only move: 12...Nxf2 is still possible.
12...Ba7
The bishop retreats a bit further, so as not to give White an additional tempo for his a2-a4-a5.

For many years — since Fleissig - Mackenzie, Vienna 1882, to be exact — 15.cxd4 f4 16.f3 Ng3 was considered to be unequivocally in Black’s favor, since after 17.hxg3 fxg3, none could see a way to prevent the black queen from getting to h2. Certainly, passive defense allows Black’s attack to grow very fierce in a very short time: for example, 18.Be3 Qh4 19.Re1 Qh2+ 20.Kf1 Bh3.
Then Boleslavsky’s painstaking investigations forced are-evaluation of the position. In his well-known games with Botvinnik and Ragozin, he showed that the continuation 18.Qd3 Bf5 19.Qxf5 Rxf5 20.Bxf5 renders the queen’s sortie harmless, since after 20...Qh4 21.Bh3 Qxd4+ 22.Kh1 Qxe5 23.Bd2, White’s pieces set up a combined pressure against the black king which occupies the queen sufficiently to prevent it from supporting the advance of Black’s pawns.
After that it was Black who began to avoid this variation, until the Moscow master Yakov Estrin came forward to suggest that Black play, instead of 23...Qxb2 (Botvinnik) or 23...c5 (Ragozin), an immediate ...d5-d4-d3. With his analyses, some of them worked out to the thirtieth move, Estrin won a number of pretty games by correspondence, achieving what, in all probability, even he had not expected: this chameleon-variation began to be avoided by both White and Black!
(A final note: it would be naive to try to keep White’s queen from h7 with 18...g6, since the queen could still reach h2 for defensive purposes from h4.)
That’s a sketch of the reasons why Averbakh recaptured on d4 with the queen instead of the pawn. That’s how matters stand today — how will they appear tomorrow? For the present, the search (White’s, now) continues.
Some Czech players have been analyzing 17.Rf2, instead of capturing the knight. Knowing Boleslavsky, I am sure he will cross swords with Estrin’s line as well, sooner or later.
Let’s get back to the game.
15...c5
16.Qd1 f4
17.f3 Ng5
The piece sacrifice 17...Ng3 would clearly have no point here (18.hxg3 fxg3 19.Qd3 Bf5 20.Qxf5 Rxf5 21.Bxf5 Qh4 22.Bh3, and Black doesn’t even have the queen check at d4), which is why the whole variation, up to and including 17...Ng5, has been considered unfavorable for Black. Szabo plays the move theory has condemned anyway, and since he shows that the knight does not really stand so badly on g5, he opens, if not a new page, then at least a new paragraph in the opening handbooks.
18.a4 ...
Black would like very much to get the knight to e6, but White does not allow him the opportunity: 18...Bf5 19.Bxf5 Rxf5 20.axb5 axb5 21.Rxa8 Qxa8 22.Qd3 forks b5 and f5.
18...b4
Black is now all set to equalize completely with ...Bf5, for instance: 19.a5 Bf5 20.Bxf4 Bxc2 21.Bxg5 Qxg5 22.Qxc2 Qxe5.
19.h4 ...
The a- and b-pawns have greeted, and passed, one another, and the game’s culminating moment has almost passed by unnoticed as well. A natural thought was 19.cxb4 cxb4 20.Qd4; but on 19.cxb4 there comes 19...c4 20.Qd4 Bf5, and the defenseless f-pawn cannot be taken safely by either queen or bishop, while the attempt to pick off the d-pawn also ends badly for White. Here are the variations:
a) 21.Bxf5 Rxf5 22.Bxf4 Ne6,
b) 21.Qxf4 Nh3+ 22.gxh3 Bxc2, and the white king’s position is unsafe,
c) 21.Bxf5 Rxf5 22.Rd1 Ne6 23.Qxd5 Qb6+ 24.Kh1 Rd8, and Black wins, thanks to his pawn on c4, which prevents White from getting his queen back to b3.
Averbakh saw through Szabo’s elegant combination; not wanting the knight on e6, however, he invited Black to sacrifice it, although this exposed him to some degree of risk.
19...Nh3+
20.gxh3 Qxh4
21.Rf2 Bxh3
22.Rh2 Rae8
23.Qxd5+ Kh8
24.Bd2 ...
This is attack and defense at their finest. By defending the pawn at e5, White threatens to throw back the black pieces by 25.Be1. Szabo, by means of a last-ditch rook sacrifice, succeeds in forcing a perpetual check. The attempt to keep his attack going with 24...Re6 would have cost him the game in view of the retort 25.Bxf4.
24...Rxe5
25.Qxe5 Qg3+
26.Kh1 Qxf3+
27.Kg1 ...
DRAW
Averbakh was excellently prepared, but failed to catch his Hungarian opponent napping: both players proved worthy of each other.
ROUND ELEVEN
71. Euwe—Averbakh
(Nimzoindian Defense)
Even with the middlegame at full boil, a master must always be thinking about the endgame. The outcome of many games, even some in which the king barely escaped direct threats and a seemingly inevitable catastrophe, has only been decided deep in the endgame. This game was typical from that standpoint, but a rarity nonetheless. Averbakh chose a plan leading to the creation of a queenside passed pawn. Knowing that a passed pawn generally increases in value as the number of pieces decreases, Averbakh resigned himself to the temporary discomforts of Euwe’s frontal assault, concluding the game with an elegant knight sacrifice in precisely the sector where the passed b-pawn had been awaiting its hour.
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6
3.Nc3 Bb4
4.e3 0-0
5.Bd3 d5
6.Nf3 c5
7.0-0 Nc6
8.a3 Bxc3
9.bxc3 b6
10.cxd5 exd5
11.Nd2 Be6
12.Bb2 c4
By developing his bishop to the long diagonal, White provoked 12...c4. This makes his intended push of the e-pawn much stronger, since that pawn would no longer need to guard d4. Averbakh is willing to meet him halfway, since he intends a rapid advance of his queenside pawn majority.
13.Bc2 b5
14.f3 a5
15.Re1 ...
I would rather have pushed the e-pawn at once.
15...Qb6
16.Nf1 b4
17.Qd2 b3
This practically guarantees Averbakh an advantage in any sort of endgame. Euwe’s plan is certainly unusual, to say the least. The problem is not so much the bishop’s retreat to b1, since it remains on the attacking diagonal, but that on the previous move he could have played his rook to c1. However, Euwe thought that Black would be unable to keep the rook imprisoned at a1, so he was unwilling to waste the tempo required to move it.
18.Bb1 a4
19.e4 Ne7
20.Ng3 Kh8
21.Re2 Nfg8
Averbakh prepares to counterattack with ...f5, in order to open some lines, trade a few pieces, and get closer to an endgame.
22.Nh5 f5
23.Qg5 Rf7
24.exf5 ...
24.e5 looks too risky: getting the queen’s rook out would be much more difficult then.
24...Bxf5
25.Bxf5 Nxf5
26.Rae1 ...
The reserve rook now speeds to the battlefront, but it might better have waited until after 26.Re5, tying Black to the defense of the d-pawn and considerably retarding his progress towards the endgame.
26...Qd8!
Beautiful sacrifices are not the only moves which deserve exclamation marks; such marks should also be placed after moves which are major links in a consistent strategic plan. The tactical justification of 26...Qd8 is that it would be dangerous for White to avoid the trade, as this would allow Black’s queen a very profitable excursion to h4.
27.Qd8 Rxd8
28.Re8 ...
Euwe was roundly criticized for this move, and later he himself recommended 28.Re6; but it is quite evident that he had already formulated his plan of going into a minor-piece endgame and maneuvering the knight via f4 and e6 to c5, followed by the capture of the a-pawn. After 28.Re6, however, the rooks would also have been traded off eventually, with pretty much the same endgame resulting.
28...Rxe8
29.Rxe8 Re7
And now the second rook must be exchanged as well, else the bishop is lost.
30.Rxe7 Ngxe7
31.Kf2 ...
On any other move, including 31.Bc1, Black would have replied 31...Ne3, winning at once.
31...Kg8
32.g4? ...
Disappointed at the failure of his original intention, to bring his knight to e6, Euwe insists on having it his way, and starts to push pawns, in hopes of regaining control of e6 and bringing the knight there after all.
No two ways about it: White does have a bad endgame. However, for the moment the position is of a closed nature, and Black must search for a spot to break through. White should play his knight to d2 or b1, and leave his g-pawn at g3. By starting now, White could get this plan carried out just as Black gets set up for the queenside breakthrough: 32.Nf4 Kf7 (otherwise 33.Ne6) 33.g3 Nd6 34.Ng2 Nb5 35.Ne3 Ke6 36.Nf1 Nc8 37.Nd2.
32...Nd6
33.Ke3 Nb5
34.f4 Nc8
35.f5 Ncd6
36.Nf4 ...
Each side has completed its preparations: White’s knight is ready to go to e6, and Black —
36...Nxa3!
Averbakh sacrifices his knight to clear the road for his pawns. A most elegant combination.
37.Bxa3 Nb5
38.Bc1 Nxc3
39.Ne2 Nb1!

11.Bg5 h6
12.Bxf6 Qxf6
13.a3 ...
The first step towards disaster. Having exchanged off his darksquare bishop, White should have redoubled his concern for the vital d4 square; instead, he weakens it — strange as that may sound — with 13.a3, which gives the black knight a bridge to transfer itself from c5 via b3 to d4. But that’s still only half a problem.
13...a4
14.Rb1 Bd7
15.h4 h5
16.Kh2 Rf8
17.Bh3
The second step, and the fatal one. Although the commentators called this an unbelievable oversight, it may be understood as the conclusion to the plan begun with his 11th move. In fact, were it not for the pawn White will lose after the exchange of bishops, he wouldn’t have all that bad a position — but that “were it not” spoils everything.
17...Bxh3

Black had the choice of several ways to exploit his advantage; one would be using the a-file, by means of ...Ra8-a5-c5, to prepare ...b5. Petrosian has a different scheme: to open up the kingside and saddle his opponent with isolated f- and h-pawns, and then to localize White’s attempt at counterplay on the queenside, leaving him with two more isolated pawns.
32.gxf4 Bxf4
33.Nxf4 Qxf4
34.Rg1 Rg8
Taking the f-pawn would have allowed White counter chances: for example, 34...Qxf3+ 35.Rg3 Qf5+ 36.Qxf5 gxf5 37.Rg5 Kh6 38.Reg2, or 35...Qf7 36.Rf2 Qd7+ 37.Kh2 Rg8 38.Rf6.

With his ship all fitted out for a long voyage, White unexpectedly heads for a quiet backwater. -A contemporary opening does permit this sort of treatment, however: White seeks a small but secure advantage from his control of the d5 square. Now we shall see a curious procession: knight, pawn, bishop, and finally the second knight, all pass through this same square, to be coolly removed by Najdorf. An endgame results in which White still has hopes for an advantage, based on his more active bishop, but these hopes go unrealized.
How is it that Boleslavsky, who re1ishes a complex game, could have chosen such a biteless line? Presumably, since he plays the Black side of the King’s Indian so frequently himself, he was unwilling to divulge his own views on the White side of one of the major variations.
Soon after the position had simplified, Najdorf, who was not at all averse to a draw, asked his opponent:
“Did you play that move for a draw?”
“No.”
“Does that mean you played it to win?”
“Mmm... Partly.”
“Maybe you played it to lose?!”
“I played the move which met the needs of the position.”
While I will not swear to the literal accuracy of the entire dialogue, I would like to draw the reader’s attention to this last retort, which so typifies Boleslavsky’s thinking.

1.c4 Nf6

3.Bg2 d5
4.Nf3 d4
This sort of aggression so early in the game cannot hurt White, ...d5-d4 is not bad in the Reti, for example, after 1.Nf3 d5 2.c4, but there the e-pawn is still on e7, and may later go to e5 in one step. In this game, a lively skirmish immediately erupts around the far-advanced black pawn.
5.b4! ...
The idea of using b2-b4 as a means of fighting for the d4 square is perhaps reminiscent of the Evans Gambit. In this position, however, the b-pawn cannot be taken: 5...Bxb4? 6.Qa4+ Nc6 7.Ne5 Be7 8.Nxc6, and if 8...Bd7 9.Nxd8 Bxa4 10.Nxb7, and White has an extra piece.
5...c5
6.Bb2 Qb6

Black’s concern over the fate of the d-pawn impels him to spend a tempo in order to induce 8.b5, thus taking the pressure off the c-pawn and strengthening his central d-pawn.

That wasn’t the right pawn. Make the move 11...c5xd4 (11...cxd4) on your board, instead of 11...e5xd4 as played, and you can see how Black obtains a mobile center and a lengthy diagonal for his darksquare bishop. After the text move, Black’s center pawns are dead, and his bishop’s powers much reduced.
12.0-0 0-0
13.d3 Bd7
It was time to start thinking about bringing his knight back home: 13...Qc7, followed by ...b6 and ...Nb7.
More than one game has been lost due to the over-optimistic assessment of one’s own position: such is the mistake Taimanov makes here. For the moment, the chances are about even. It would be hard to single out any specific White advantage, but, in any event, Black has none. Black will spend the rest of the game trying to drum up counterplay on the queenside — against what? Soon, White will move out his entire herd of pieces from the area to the left and below the diagonal pawn-chains; then, after the exchange of rooks (which Black initiates), the question of who controls these squares will cease to be of any importance whatever. If Black does not exchange rooks, however, White will seize the e-file.

The exclamation mark is not for any one move, but for the whole of White’s original plan, which is: to remove every single one of his pieces from the queenside, and set up an attack on the king, making use of the numerical superiority he enjoys there, due to the absence from that sector of one black knight.
19...a6
20.a4 Qa7
21.Nf5 Bf8
A strategic technique of which Taimanov makes frequent use: leaving his king in its keep, under the protection of his two bishops, he undertakes the decisive action on the queenside. The only reason this technique fails him in this instance is that there he will find absolutely nothing and no one to attack.

With the knight on b3 now, the sacrifice at h6 would lead only to a perpetual check, since the black queen could rejoin the defense via d7.
28.Qd1 Qa2
The continuation of his mistaken plan. Black wants to attack the base of white’s pawn chain at d3 from the rear, but he also has a weak pawn at b6, which is easier to assail, being further removed from its own pieces. In fact, this factor has already forced Black to avoid the exchange of queens: 28...Qa1 29.Qxa1 Nxa1 30.Bc7, and the black pawn chain crumbles.

75. Geller—Gligoric
(King’s Indian)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 g6
3.Nc3 Bg7
4.e4 d6
5.f3 ...
Samisch’s Variation is the King’s Indian’s fierce foe. Surrounded by his g2-f3-e4-d5-c4 palisade, White calmly develops his pieces on the squares left open, while Black is unable even to dream of breaking in the center, and must place all his hopes in a wing attack. Here too, however, life is no bowl of cherries, since White’s king, which is the chief target of his assault, will be spirited away to the queen-side, robbing Black’s pawn press ...f7-f5-f4 of much of its effect by rendering it largely pointless,
Meanwhile, White has a wider choice of strategic plans. With the center closed, he may attack on the kingside with g4, h4 and h4-h5 etc., or try for a queenside break by leading away from his own king with a pawn attack. Before deciding on an active plan, both White and Black engage in a lengthy war of maneuver, of the sort that occurs in many contemporary grandmaster games. Generally speaking, the ideas behind such play are: to find the best possible positions for one’s pieces, to restrict the opponent’s initiative, to trade off one’s own “bad” bishop for the enemy’s «good» one, and finally, to prepare a break. In the present game, for example, up until the 42nd move only one piece and one pawn had been exchanged. At that moment, however, the game entered its combinative phase, and the reader who has followed the phase preceding that with diligent attention will be richly rewarded for his pains. He will see sacrifices, counter-sacrifices, feints and kingside attacks — in a word, all the trappings of a lively game.
5...0-0
6.Be3 e5
7.d5 Nh5
This is not the only plan for Black. He might also play 7...c6, attempting to undermine the center, or 7...a5, to bring a knight to c5; but as Makogonov showed in his day, White’s attack on the kingside moves very swiftly. If Black prepares ...f5 by dropping his knight back to e8, then 8.g4 sometimes follows, giving White the opportunity to open the g-file for his rooks with a later g4xf5.
Black’s choice in this game is the end product of a battle of ideas of many years’ duration. From h5, the knight mechanically prevents h4-h5, which consequently renders the push h2-h4 at least temporarily useless; and on 8.g4, then knight goes to f4, halting White’s attack. 7...Nh5 also prepares 8...f5: all logical enough, but no more than that.
8.Qd2 f5
9.0-0-0 f4
Black closes the game in the only sector where he had any chance to stir up some activity for his pieces — why? The answer comes from Gligoric’s next two moves, but it’s hardly a satisfactory one. Black wants to trade off the darksquare bishops with ...Bg7-f6-h4, but he is unable to achieve this. It is possible that on 9...Nbd7 or 9...Qe8, as Geller himself usually plays for Black, Gligoric was afraid of 10.exf5 gxf5 11.g4; in that event, he should continue 11...fxg4 12.fxg4 Nf4. White may get open diagonals, but they will not be easily occupied, and Black will get his chances too. He who plays the King’s Indian must be prepared for dangerous variations. With his 9...f4, Black resigns himself to having less say in the game.
10.Bf2 Bf6
11.Nge2 Bh4
12.Bg1
With a pawn chain entirely on light squares, Geller naturally does not intend to be deprived of his darksquare bishop. True, the rook is shut in, but it takes two black pieces (the knight on h5 and the bishop on h4) to keep it in. (Note that 11...Bh4 is made possible by the combination 12.g3 fxg3 13.hxg3 Rxf3).

Gligoric considers his position strong enough to withstand a siege, but against passive play by Black, sooner or later White will find a way to break through. 16...c5 was worth a thought here, in order to hem in the bishop on g1 and perhaps give his own bishop an exit via d8. White would most likely have taken
en passant
, leading to a livelier game.

The threat of 22.c5 forces Black to retreat his rook to f8, and on the following move to play 22...b6. Having already passed up the chance to enliven his game, Black must now wait and watch as White improves his position and prepares his break. Now Black’s chances lie in whatever accidental tactical shots may happen to present themselves.

The onslaught White now sets in motion is not so much aggressive as prophylactic in nature. Before breaking on the queen-side, White wants to secure the king’s wing, fearing that once all of his pieces have left that sector, Gligoric will find a favorable opportunity to play ...g6-g5-g4. But now the base of White’s pawn chain is weakened, giving Black the opportunity for a break by means of a piece sacrifice.

Black cannot allow this bishop to get to c6, and so he is forced to play this active move, resulting in the first exchange of pawns and the opening of the c-file for White. White can no longer play his break at c5, but that’s not necessary any longer, since its purpose — to open an attacking line — has already been attained by other means; so he turns to an attack on the c- and b-pawns. The former will be hard to get, since it is easily defended by minor pieces; the latter must be isolated from the bishop at d7, for which purpose the maneuver Ne2-c1-d3-b4-c6 will be useful — but that will mean pulling White’s last piece away from the king’s wing ...

Unexpectedly wrecking White’s maneuvering game. Sacrifices such as this one are always in the air around immobile pawn chains. Not just the pawns, but the pieces behind them also become much more active, and White must go on the defensive for a time.
43.fxg4 Bxg4
44.Rh1 ...
Geller prefers to give up the exchange, rather than allow his opponent to get three connected passed pawns.
44...Bf3
45.Qe1 c5
46.dxc6 Raxc6
How pitiful Black’s pieces appeared, cooped up in the narrow space behind their pawn chain; and how his whole position begins to sparkle, once his pawns are set in motion! If Black succeeds in picking up that last center pawn, then of course White would no longer be able to hold the game; otherwise, alas, it is still Gligoric who must strive for the draw.
47.Bd5 Bxh1
48.Qxh1 Qd7
49.Rxc6 Rxc6
50.Bxc6 Qxc6
51.Nd3 ...
With all of Black’s resourcefulness, the position is still uncertain. Geller has held on to his extra piece and his center pawn too; if he can get his knight to d5, then Black must perish. If Black can get in ...d5, obtaining three connected passed pawns, then the battle will flare anew. White’s last move aims at seizing control of d5, but it gives Black a second chance. On the other hand, 51.Qf3 would allow Black the possibility 51...Qd7 and 52...g4.
51...Qc4
52.Qf3 d5
53.Nxe5 Qf1+!
54.Kc2 dxe4
55.Qxe4 Qxf2+
Black has perpetual check, but no more than that, since his own king is too exposed.
56.Kd3 Qf1+
57.Kc2 Qf2+
58.Kd3 Qf1+
59.Kc2 Qf2+
DRAW
76. Smyslov—Bronstein
(Reti Opening)
1.c4 Nf6
2.g3 c6
3.Nf3 d5
4.b3 Bf5
If Black wants indisputable equality against the Reti, then the setup with ...c7-c6 and developing the bishop to f5 seems best to me, following the classic example Reti - Lasker. There have, of course, been cases in which the bishop ended up out of action on the diagonal b1-h7, but only because Black played in stereotyped fashion, without considering circumstances.
5.Bg2 e6
6.0-0 Nbd7
7.Bb2 Be7
8.Nc3 0-0
After long thought, Black decided to castle and do without ...h6 for the time being. Someone once said — and many now believe — that loss of time is meaningless in closed positions. If this is true, then it is true only for thoroughly closed positions, not for the kind that now exists upon this board. It seems to me that 8...h6 would have been an unnecessary waste of time here.
9.Nh4
Smyslov reacts immediately to Black’s “inaccuracy”, intending first to trade off the bishop at g6, then to play c4xd5, and then to prepare e2-e4, in order to clear the center of pawns and secure great activity for his pieces.
9...Bg4
A small subterfuge: Black conceals his aggressive intentions behind the mask of forced play.
10.h3 Bh5
11.g4 ...
Either White has underrated his .opponent’s ideas, or he is simply being careless: Black’s long think after 8.Nc3 ought to have forewarned him.
Smyslov probably thought that Black was just putting on a show of intending to sacrifice a piece; and in fact, after 11...Bxg4 12.hxg4 Nxg4 13.Nf3, Black would have no threats whatever. A little
zwischenzug
, however, alters the position substantially.
It should be mentioned that Black had just such a turn of events in mind when he pondered his eighth move, keeping in mind that 11...Bg6 12.Nxg6 hxg6 13.d4 would have left White with a definite advantage.
11...d4
12.Nb1 ...
Taking the bishop would not be good (12.gxh5), in view of 12...dxc3 13.Bxc3 Nxh5 14.Nf3 Bf6 15.d4 Nf4; and after 12.Na4, ...b7-b5 is an immediate threat.
12...Bxg4
13.hxg4 Nxg4
Naturally, I could not calculate all the consequences of the sacrifice, but considering a few of the variations, I felt that Black would have good chances for an attack, or — and sometimes this can be more important — for the steady improvement of his position. For example: 14.Nf3 Bd6, followed by ...f7-f5, ...Qf6, and ...Re8, with the standing threat of ...e6-e5-e4.
14.e4 Nxf2
White mistakenly allowed a tactical shot which could have decided the game at once: 14...Ba3, and if 15.Qxg4, Black recovers his piece, coming out two pawns to the good. On 15.Bxa3, Black would get a third pawn with a strengthened attack: 15...Qxh4 16.Re1 Qxf2+ 17.Kh1 Qh4+ 18.Kg1, and now the quiet 18...c5 is possible, as are the more energetic 18...f5 or 18...Nde5.
In this variation, Black must play for some little time a rook down, which to me seemed excessive. Afraid perhaps of nothing more than having to end this game with a perpetual check, I decided to comfort myself by taking a third pawn for the piece. Evidently, this was an inaccurate assessment of the position.
15.Rxf2 Bxh4
16.Rf3 Ne5
17.Rh3 Bg5
First of all, this retreat to g5 prevents the d-pawn’s advance, when there would follow 18...Be3+, 19...f5 and 20...Ng4; secondly, it prepares 18...d3; and third1y, it neutralizes the threatened 18.Qh5, in view of the reply 18...h6.
18.Na3 Ng6
19.Nc2 Nf4
20.Rh2 ...
White might have given rook for knight and pawn here: 20.Bxd4 Nxh3+ 21.Bxh3 Bf6, but now 22.e5 fails against 22...Bxe5 and 23...Qg5+.
20...d3!
A decisive maneuver: in conjunction with the trade of bishops that ensues, this puts White in a difficult position.
21.Ne3 Ne2+
22.Kh1 f5
Black here declined white’s offer of a draw, certainly with some justification: the three connected passed pawns he now obtains will be a great danger to White’s pieces.
23.exf5 exf5
24.Bf3 Ng3+
25.Kg1 Bf6
A positional move, aiming to exchange off one of the few active white pieces.
26.Bxf6 Qxf6
27.Qe1 ...
27...f4
A serious error. Having written the winning move, 27...Rae8, down on my scoresheet, and with my hand already reaching for the rook, I changed my mind at the last moment, and spent the rest of the game regretting this lost opportunity.
28.Ng4 Qd4+
29.Kg2 Rae8
30.Qg1! Qb2
31.Qc1 Qd4
32.Qc3 ...
Smyslov’s fighting qualities must be acknowledged: even in a slightly inferior position, he declines a repetition and risks an immediate loss. Trading queens here would have given Black four passed pawns and all sorts of winning chances. On the other hand, maybe Smyslov did not like the idea of retreating his queen back to g1, after which Black could play his queen to d6, instead of b2 again.
32...Qd6
33.c5 Qg6
34.Qc4+ Kh8
35.Rh3 h5
Courage! Black runs up under the rook’s fire to “attack” the knight with a pinned pawn.
36.Kh2 Qh7
37.Nf2 g5
38.Qd4+ Kg8
39.Qc4+ Kh8
40.Qd4+ Kg8
Here the game was adjourned, and White offered a
DRAW
the next day. I saw no way of improving the position of my pieces substantially; for that matter, I had practically agreed to the draw with my 30th move. White needed only the check on c4 for a three-time repetition, and so I took Smyslov’s offer.
Imagine my surprise upon discovering that the sealed move had been 41.Ra1-g1 (41.Rg1): once again Smyslov had declined the draw! It seems to me, however, that this move would have given Black good winning chances once again after 41...Qg6: then Black could answer the check by moving his king to h7, followed by either ...g5-g4 or ...h5 - h4. Now White’s pieces would remain tied up by Black’s pawns; and if White were to carry out the threat implicit in his 41.Rg1, which is: to sacrifice the exchange back with 42.Rhxg3 fxg3+ 43.Rxg3, Black could keep the initiative by means of the continuation 43...h4 44.Rh3 Rf4, with strong pressure on the e-and f-files. Smyslov and his second Simagin, however, thought that the immediate 41...h4 42.Ng4, etc. was forced for Black, and it’s hard to say which of the two of us was right. When a game is adjourned in a complex position, usually each side unconsciously evaluates the position in his own favor.
What conclusions can be drawn from this tense and interesting struggle? First: even in the most important games, one may, if conditions are right, employ a sacrifice which cannot be analyzed in detail; second: if a mistake or an inaccuracy occurs, there is no need to assume “all is lost” and mope — one must reorient oneself quickly, and find a new plan to fit the new situation.
77. Keres—Reshevsky
(Nimzoindian Defense)
If the reader should ask which game I liked the best of all in this tournament, I would have to pass over my own two encounters with onetime American
wunderkind
Samuel Reshevsky in favor of one of the tournament’s most noteworthy games from the viewpoint of its depth of conception, beauty and complexity. This game has been reproduced in chess journals in every language, and has been subjected to dissection by dozens of masters, almost all of the grandmasters, and even Botvinnik himself — and yet we still cannot say with absolute certainty that these analyses represent the final answer. The reader will have the opportunity to examine for himself, and perhaps to add his own contribution to the collective effort of all the world’s chessplayers.
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6
3.Nc3 Bb4
4.e3 c5
5.Bd3 0-0
6.a3 Bxc3+
7.bxc3 b6
Here 7...Nc6 is usually played; after 8.Ne2 b6 9.e4 Ne8, a type of position is reached which is well-known from the games Botvinnik - Reshevsky (Moscow 1948), Bronstein - Najdorf (Budapest 1950), and Geller - Smyslov, from this tournament. Reshevsky repeats the opening he played against Euwe, but where White was unable to summon the courage to play 8.e4 in that game, Keres does so here.
8.e4 Bb7
9.Bg5 ...
R.G. Ashurov, a Class-A player from Baku, has pointed out a different possibility for White here: 9.e5, and if 9...Bxg2, then 10.Bg5 Bxh1 11.exf6 g6 12.Bxg6! hxg6 13.Qg4 with a very strong attack, which Ashurov carries out to mate in several lines. True, some of these variations could be improved for Black, but without a doubt he gets into serious trouble if he takes the pawn and the rook. His best reply to 9.e5 would be to retreat the knight, when White could maintain the pressure with 10.Qh5.
9...h6
Fierce! 9...d6 was also possible: if 10.e5 dxe5 11.dxe5, then Black would not play 11...Bxg2, which would lead to a complete collapse of his game in very short order, but 11...Be4! On 9...d6, White would probably have continued 10.f4 Nbd7 11.Nf3 cxd4 12.cxd4, with a much more active position; so Black prefers to force matters.
10.h4 ...
Continuing his development. It’s easy to see that if Black were to take the bishop here, he would have to return it at once, since 10...hxg5 11.hxg5 Nxe4? 12.Qh5 f5 13.g6 would win quickly.
10...d6
11.e5 dxe5
12.dxe5 Be4!
The only move: 12...hxg5 leads to 13.exf6 Qxf6 14.Bh7+ Kh8 15.hxg5 Qxc3+ 16.Kf1, and White wins; if 12...Bxg2, then 13.Bxf6 gxf6 14.Qg4+ Kh8 15.Qxg2 Qxd3 16.Rh3, and Black loses his queen’s rook; and finally, if 12...Qc7, then 13.exf6 Bxg2 14.fxg7 Qe5+ 15.Kd2 Re8 16.Nf3!, and White saves his rook, coming out a piece ahead.
13.Rh3! ...
The only move: as the reader can easily determine, taking the knight with either the bishop or the pawn would give Black a favorable ending.
13...Bxd3
14.Rxd3 Qc7
The best chance to defend his difficult position. In such situations, many players are ready to throw up their hands and play the first move that comes to mind; but Reshevsky does not despair.
White has several means of destroying the black king’s pawn cover. Here Keres concocted an astounding combination, whose main variation runs roughly as follows: 15.Bxf6 gxf6 16.Qg4+ Kh8 17.Qf3 Nd7 18.0-0-0 Nxe5 19.Qxf6+ Kh7 20.Rd6 Nxc4 21.Nh3 Nxd6 22.Ng5+! Kg8 23.Qxh6 f5 24.Nxe6 Qh7 25.Qxh7+ Kxh7 26.Nxf8+ Rxf8 27.Rxd6 — and the rook ending will pose few problems for White.
There are certainly many other possibilities for both sides a-long the way, which no one could possibly have calculated; but the extended conception of unusual beauty is a hallmark of Keres’ talent.
And now the reader who would like to poke about with us through the byways of these combinations should follow the analysis, as Nimzovich once recommended, on two chessboards: one to make the moves of the game, and the other to examine the variations.
15.Bxf6 ...
15.exf6 hxg5 16.hxg5 is also quite good enough here — Najdorf, in fact, considered it “interesting, and probably the winning line”— 16...Qe5+ 17.Kf1 Qxg5 18.fxg7 Rc8 19.Rg3 Qf4 20.Rh3 Qxc4+ 21.Ne2 Nc6 22.Qd2.
Nedeljkovic and Vukovic put forward 19.Qf3 Nc6 20.Qh3 in this line, as well as the alternatives:
a) 16...gxf6 17.gxf6 Qe5+ 18.Kf1 Qxf6 19.Rg3+ Kh7 20.Qh5+ Qh6 21.Qf3;
b) 16...Qh2 17.Kf1 Qh4 18.Rh3! Qxc4+ 19.Ne2 e5 20.Qd6 Qe6 21.Qd3 e4 22.Qg3 gxf6 23.Qh4.
V. Turchuk has rightly upbraided me for uncritically accepting this analysis, pointing out that, instead of 21.Qd3, White could give mate in three by 21.Rh8+, 22.Qxf8+, and 23.Qxg7. After that, I critically re-examined the variation, and came up with 21.Qxf8+! Kxf8 22.Rh8 — mate again, and in one move less!
Euwe also thinks that the knight ought to have been taken with the pawn, but that after 15...hxg5 the proper continuation is not 16.hxg5 (as Najdorf would have it), but 16.fxg7: for example,
a) 16...Kxg7 17.Qh5 gxh4 18.Qxh4, with the threat of 19.Rg3+;
b) 16...Qe5+ 17.Re3 Qxg7 18.Rg3 f6 19.Nf3, threatening 20.Nxg5.
As we can see, all of the commentators agree that this continuation (15.exf6) was clearer, and would have led to a quicker win. There were indeed two ways to win, but the line White actually chose was no less forcing and no less beautiful than those that were suggested
post mortem
. Obviously, once Keres had come up with a plan that was good enough to win, he carried it out without distracting himself by calculating new complexities.
15...gxf6
16.Qg4+ ...
White had an exceptionally beautiful attacking continuation here: 16.f4!, keeping the black queen from e5. The main line runs as follows:
16...Kh7 17.Nh3 Rg8 18.Qh5 Nc6 19.exf6 Rg6 20.0-0-0 Rd8 21.Rxd8 Nxd8 22.Ng5+ Kg8 23.Rxd8+! Qxd8
24.Qxg6+!! fxg6 25.f7+ Kh8 26.Nxe6, when knight and pawn overcome a queen.
Such a combination, however, is not easily calculated over the board, especially when one takes into account such diversions as:
a) 16...Kh7 17.Nh3 Qb7, and it would not be easy for White to find the proper move, which is 18.Ra2;
b) 16...fxe5 17.Rg3+ Kh7 18.Qg4 f5 19.Qg6+ Kh8 20.Qxh6+ Qh7 21.Qxf8+;
c). 16...Nc6 17.Rd7 Qb8 18.Qg4+ Kh8 19.Qh5.
Grandmaster Botvinnik recommended 16.exf6!, and that may be the most meaningful thing the reader will learn from these five pages.
16...Kh8
17.Qf3 ...
Keres continues his idea. 17.Rg3 would have been insufficient in view of 17...Qxe5+ 18.Re3 Qc7 19.Rg3 Qe5+; if 18.Kf1 or 18.Ne2, then 18...f5, and Black can defend. Nothing comes of 17.Nf3 Nd7! 18.Rxd7 Qxd7 19.exf6 Rg8 20.Qh5 Qd3! 21.Qxh6+ Qh7 22.Qf4 Rxg2 either; but 17.0-0-0 Qxe5 18.Nf3 Qc7 19.Rd6 Nc6 20.Qf4 Kg7 21.g4 and 22.g5 looks very strong: if 17...Nc6, then 18.f4 fxe5 19.Rd7 Qc8 20.Qh5 Kg7 21.f5!
17...Nd7
18.0-0-0 ...
Trifunovic, and Reshevsky himself in later analysis, pointed out the winning move (in their opinion), 18.Rd6. Indeed, White wins after both 18...fxe5 19.0-0-0 and 18...f5 19.Qf4 Kh7 20.0-0-0; but the defense 18...Kg7, threatening 19...Nxe5 (this was suggested by the German analyst Rellstab) is sufficient to draw. For example, 19.exf6+ Nxf6 20.0-0-0 Qe7, or 19.Qg3+ Kh8 20.Qf4 Kg7, etc.
18...Nxe5
19.Qxf6+ Kh7
20.Rd6 Nxc4
For the first time in this game, no doubt, Reshevsky breathed a sigh of relief. Indeed, he has no worries over 21.Rd7 Qe5 22.Rxf7+ Rxf7 23.Qxf7+ Qg7, when Black may even threaten mate in some lines himself: 24.Qf3, for instance, allows 24...b5!
21.Nf3 ...
Reshevsky could have given up his queen for two rooks and a better defense here. 21.Nh3 was more exact; then after the trade of the queen for two rooks White could continue 23.f3, followed by 24.g4 and 25.Nf4, with an undiminished attack, in spite of the attenuated material. Once Reshevsky took the rook with his knight, Keres could finally enter the concluding phase of his outstanding combination.
21...Nxd6
22.Ng5+ ...
If Black takes the knight, nothing can save him from mate.
22...Kg8
23.Qxh6 ...
A glance at the position will reveal a noticeable similarity between it and the position mentioned in the note to Black’s 14th. Here, however, Reshevsky sidesteps the main line: instead of 23...f5, he plays
23...f6
which, in conjunction with Black’s next, is far stronger.
24.Nxe6 Qe7
25.Rxd6 ...
Under severe time pressure, with his emotions in a turmoil from the whole preceding phase of the struggle, Keres fails to find the correct maneuver: 25.Qg6+ Kh8 26.Qh5+ Kg8 27.Rd3! Ne4 (27...Qh7 runs into 28.Qxh7+, 29.Nxf8+, and 30.Rxd6 — i.e., Keres’ main line) 28.Nxf8 Rxf8 29.Qg4+ Ng5 30.Re3 Qg7 31.Rg3 Kh8 32.hxg5. However, Keres cannot be faulted for missing this, since many of the commentators, in quieter circumstances and after lengthy analysis, also failed to discover this winning plan, suggesting instead 28.Qg6+ Kh8 29.Nxf8 Rxf8 30.Re3, which doesn’t work, because Black does not play 30...f5 31.f3!, but 30...Rg8 31.Qh6+ Qh7, or 31.Rxe4 Rxg6 32.Rxe7 Rxg2, with a drawn ending.
25...Rf7
26.Qd2 ...
A time-pressure move, but his selection was already limited. Nothing was to be gained by 26.Qg6+ Kh8 27.Rd5 Rh7, while 26.Rc6 c4! 27.Kb2 Re8 28.f4 Qd7 29.f5 Qxc6 30.Qg6+ Kh8 31.Qxf7 Qxg2+ probably leads to a draw. 26.f4 is also unclear, in view of 26...Rh7 27.Qg6+ Kh8, when 28.f5 is no good in view of 28...Rg8.
Nedeljkovic and Vukovic’s recommendation, 26.g4, is not bad.
26...Re8
27.f4 ...
27.g4 was better here, answering 27...f5 with 28.g5, and 27...Qb7 with 28.Qd3. White would have retained some winning chances.
27...f5
Now Black has fully equal play.
28.Qd5 Kh8
For one thing, Reshevsky could have taken the pawn here: 28...Qxh4 leaves White nothing better than the queen ending after 29.Rd8 Rxd8 30.Nxd8 Qxf4+ 31.Kb2 Qc7 32.Nxf7 Qxf7, where Black obtains winning chances.
29.Qe5+ Qf6
30.Kc2 c4
31.Kd2 Kg8
32.Qd5 Qxh4
33.Qxc4 Qf2+
34.Kc1 Qg1+
35.Kc2 Qxg2+
36.Kb3 b5
A trap which also secures the c4 square, where the exchange of queens will shortly take place.
37.Qd4 ...
The black queen ought to have been kept out of f1, which could have been accomplished by 37.Qd3.
37...Qf1
38.Kb4 Qc4+
Reshevsky had only a few seconds left for three moves, so it is not clear whether he rejected or did not see the tempting move 38...Rf6. The queen could not take the rook, in view of 39...Qc4+, with mate next; and on 39.Qd5, of course, Black would trade queens; but 39.Rd8 Rxe6 40.Rxe8+ Rxe8 41.Qd5+ would appear to save White.
39.Qxc4 bxc4
40.Kxc4 Rc8+
41.Kb5! ...
Here the game was adjourned. Both players analyzed all night and the next day as well — not the adjourned position, of course, but the game which led up to it. Both Keres and Reshevsky knew there was no need to play off the adjourned position beyond the opening of the sealed move; if they had known better, then at least one would not have agreed to the
DRAW
without playing on.
ROUND TWELVE
78. Bronstein—Keres
(Sicilian Defense)
1.e4 c5
2.Nc3 g6
3.g3 Bg7
4.d3 Nc6
5.Bg2 Rb8
Maybe a little bit too straightforward — an opinion Black soon comes to share himself. On b8 the rook supports the onrush of the b-pawn, which is the sort of forceful assault that makes sense only when conducted in the neighborhood of the white king. In the present game, however, White secures his king in the right-hand corner.
6.f4 d6
7.Nf3 e6
8.0-0 Nge7
General considerations impelled White to push his e-pawn to e5, without worrying about its loss, since this opens at least three lines: White’s half of the e-file, the c1-h6 diagonal, and the g2-c6 diagonal. In addition, the excellent post at e4 is cleared for White’s queen’s knight.
9.e5 dxe5
Naturally, Black could also have continued with 9...d5, maintaining a closed position where his lag in development would not have been so important — that’s probably how he should have played it.
10.fxe5 Nxe5
11.Bf4 Nxf3+
The knight seizes its chance to escape with check. Attempting to maintain it on e5 would only mean more trouble for the king, for example:
I. 11...f6 12.Bxe5 fxe5 13.Ng5;
II. 11...N7c6 12.Nxe5 Nxe5 13.Qe2;
III. 11...0-0 12.Nxe5 Qd4+ 13.Kh1 Bxe5 14.Nb5 Qxb2 15.Rb1.
12.Qxf3 Ra8
Hitting the bishop with 12...e5 would have been useless, since that piece is aching for a chance to leave the f-file anyway, and taking a pawn en route makes it even better. The bishop also would not be averse to leaving f4 for e5 now, after the rook’s return to a8; but in that event Black could castle, thereby exercising his right to “make three moves in one”.(We have grown so used to castling that we think of it as just another move, when in fact it. is not: the rook moves from h8 to f8, defending f7, while the king leaps from e8 to g8, defending the bishop at g7.)
13.Be3 ...
White is not above taking the c-pawn. 13.Bc7 would be a mistake, in view of 13...Bd4 or Qd4+.
13...0-0
14.Bxc5 Bd4+
Symptomatic: in this type of position, White usually spends considerable effort in order to enforce an exchange of dark-square bishops, so that the important squares f6 and h6, so close to Black’s king, may be the more easily occupied by White’s pieces. The fact that it is Black who initiates the trade of bishops here shows that he is by now unable to think in terms of principles, but only of how to reduce the number of attacking pieces, which nearly always benefits the defender.
15.Bxd4 Qxd4+
16.Kh1 Rb8
As long as White has not yet come up with any concrete threats to mate or to win material, Black should strive to develop his queen’s bishop as quickly as possible — that’s the idea behind this rook move (...b6 and ...Bb7). Time, however, is an expensive commodity in chess. On b8 the rook is unprotected once again, and soon comes under fire from the queen.
Good or bad, he ought to have played either 16...Nc6 or an immediate 16...e5.
17.Ne4 ...
The knight cannot be kept away from f6. At e4, it simultaneously masks the f4 square, through which the white queen intends to slip into h6; with the queen at h6, Ne4-f6+ would be fatal for Black, so he hits at the knight immediately. Once again, Keres is playing concretely, with hardly a thought for the weak pawn, subject to frontal assault, that he gets on e6.
17...f5
18.Qf4 Bd7
Black’s move may be understood in terms of the proverb,” Better late than never”. In this case, however, never would have been better.
The only chance to continue fighting lay in 18...Ra8, strange as that might sound. Black would have had serious difficulties, of course, but there seems to be no forced win for White. One could hardly imagine such a game, where the black rook swings like a pendulum from a8 to b8 and back, and yet even then Black is still able to maintain the balance somehow.
All Black needs now is one small thing — his turn to move.
19.c3 ...
Giving the queen its choice of moving forward, left or right. By going forward to d3 (19...Qxd3), Black risks losing a piece after 20.Nc5 Qb5 21.Qd6; by retreating leftward, to the kingside, Black would allow the knight to get to c5; so therefore, the queen retreats rightward, to the queenside, retaining control of c5 and d6. But now the wolf comes in through a different door — and once again, the queen’s rook is the culprit.
19...Qb6
20.Nf6+ Rxf6
The importunate knight must be removed regardless of the cost, since otherwise it not only captures the bishop on d7, but also forks all three of Black’s heavy pieces (20...Kg7? 21.Nxd7!).
21.Qxb8+ Bc8
The unfortunate rook has perished at last, leaving behind a shattered army on the battlefield.
22.d4 Rf8
23.Rf2 Nc6
24.Qf4 Bd7

Black has no compensation at all for his lost exchange, so the rest really requires no comment, except to say that White certainly did not play the second half of the game in the best possible way.

4.g3 b6
5.Bg2 Bb7
6.0-0 Be7
7.d4 ...
The game has transposed into the Queen’s Indian, but the transposition has been a favorable one for Black: having gotten his ...c7-c5 in before White’s d2-d4, he can now trade off this center pawn without permitting the cramping d4-d5.
7...cxd4
8.Qxd4 0-0
9.Rd1 Nc6
10.Qf4 Qb8
Completely neutralizing White’s attempts at any sort of opening advantage.
11.Qxb8 Raxb8
12.Bf4 Rbc8
13.Bd6 ...
Is it possible that this harmless attempt to establish himself on d6 was the reason White essayed this whole variation? By this time, 13.Ne5 was the better course.
13...Bxd6
14.Rxd6 Ne7
15.Ne5 ...
This looks aggressive, but it turns out to be a blunder that costs a pawn. Even blunders, however, have their reasons sometimes. For this encounter, Gligoric chose a cautious opening, in which it is usually difficult to secure an advantage; he also went in for early simplifications, resulting in a completely drawish position. At that moment, suddenly, White began playing for a win! The logic of chess does not permit such things: once a position of clear equilibrium has been established, it takes more than simple will-power to tip the scales.
And it was not yet too late to defend the c-pawn: 15.b3 Nf5 16.Rd3 d5 17.cxd5 Nxd5 18.Nxd5 Bxd5.
15...Bxg2
16.Kxg2 Nf5
Naturally! Black drives the rook off first, then the knight, and then takes the c-pawn. Luckily for White, he still has 18.e4, allowing him to double Black’s pawns.
17.Rd2 d6
18.e4 Nxg3
19.hxg3 dxe5
20.b3 ...
There exists a widespread, and therefore dangerous, misconception that the win is automatic once you are a pawn ahead. As a matter of fact, Black’s chief advantage in this position lies not so much in his plus pawn, which he is still far from exploiting, as in his control of most of the center squares: d4, d5, c5, f4 and f5.
White has his counterchances: a queenside pawn majority and the d-file. How many similar games have been drawn because of inexact play! Smyslov, however, manages such endings with an iron hand. His plan may be divided into the following phases:
1. The immediate exchange of one rook, leaving the other to restrain White’s queenside pawns and attack the c- and e-pawns.
2. Deflecting White’s rook to the h-file by the threat to create an outside passed pawn, and then occupying the, d-file with his own rook.
3. Advancing the g-pawn to g4, undermining the e-pawn’s support, which is the f3-pawn.
4. Tying up White’s pieces by attacking the e-pawn.
5. Sending his king in to pick off the weak pawns.
As we shall see, a simple winning plan — for a Smyslov, naturally!

28.fxg4 Nxg4+
29.Ke2 Nf6

Now the e-pawn is twice attacked; Black intends to continue ...Ke7-f8-g7-g6-g5-g4.
31.Rf1 Ng4+
32.Ke2 Kf8
33.Rf3 Kg7
34.Rd3 ...
White sees the writing on the wall, and resolves to try his luck in a knight ending. But this can only be achieved at the cost of giving Black a passed d-pawn.
34...Kf6
Now that a rook exchange is in the offing, Black alters his king’s itinerary. After the automatic 34...Kg6 35.Rxd4 exd4 36.Nb5 e5 37.Nxa7 White has some hope.
35.Rxd4 exd4
36.Nb5 Ke5
37.Nxa7 Kxe4
38.Nc8 ...
One last swindle: 38...e5? 39.Nd6 is mate! If he wanted to play on a while longer, however, 38.Nb5 was better. Now the king is left completely alone against king, knight and a powerful passed pawn.

80. Taimanov—Geller
(King’s Indian)
Perusal of this meaty game will acquaint the reader with two strategic ideas. As a result of the opening Black obtains the pawn configuration c5-d6-e5 versus c4-d5-e4; this ensures White greater freedom to maneuver within his own lines, since he has three ranks, while Black has only two. This is an abstract advantage, of course, but it is the master’s task to render it concrete — that is, to find a plan wherein this will prove useful. It is instructive to watch as Taimanov practically clears his first three ranks of pawns entirely, enabling him to transfer his forces easily from one wing to the other, while most of Black’s pieces find themselves jostling one another on the seventh rank, and especially on the eighth.
And the second idea: White doubles his rooks on the b-file, but cannot turn this to account, since all the good invasion squares are covered by Black’s minor pieces. White therefore stirs up some play on the other wing; harmless in itself, this play leads to the exchange of a few pieces and draws the minor pieces away from the b-file, thus allowing White’s rooks to invade at b7 and conclude the game within a few moves.

Geller’s ninth move completed his array; now he intends 10...exd4, with activization, so Taimanov crosses him up by pushing his center pawn.
10.d5 ...
Offering Black the choice of trading on d5 or closing the center — or doing neither. The trade would make sense only if White’s bishop were on g2 and Black’s rook on f8. Maintaining tension with 10...Qe7 and 11...a5, followed eventually by ...Nc5 and ...f7-f5, looks good here. As to Geller’s choice, 10...c5, that’s a matter of chessic taste: it seems to me that Black has a harder time obtaining counterplay in the King’s Indian with a locked pawn configuration.
10...c5
11.g3 ...
A far-sighted move whose point will become clear later on.
11...Nf8
12.a3 Ng4
13.Nh4 a6
Black refrained from his intended 13...f5, seeing 14.exf5 gxf5 15.Bh3, threatening 16.Nxf5 and 17.Bxg4, and if 15...Qf6, then 16.Ne4 fxe4 17.Bxg4. Thus, 11.g3 was directed against 13...f5:
White gave his knight support at h4, and opened a path for the bishop to h3. Najdorf’s suggestion 13...Bf6 14.Ng2 Bg7 is not entirely convincing, inasmuch as 14...Bxh4 is not a threat: White can reply to 13...Bf6 with 14.f3 Bxh4 15.gxh4 Nf6 16.Bg5 Kg7 17.Qd2.

White sees that it is not yet time to invade: 20.Qc6 Ra7 21.Qxd6? Rc7!! traps the queen.
20...h4
An attack on the king with such limited means can hardly accomplish much. As long as White still has no concrete threats on the queenside, Black might as well have continued his preparations for ...f7-f5.
21.Nd1 hxg3
22.fxg3 Nb8
To complete this picture, Black need only “follow through” with ...Bh8. The position illustrates the meaning of the phrase, “freedom of maneuver”. A white rook on b3 will control the b-file and simultaneously defend f3 and g3. In some variations, the rook on b1 goes to h1, and the knight on d1 may go to c3, e3 or f2; meanwhile, Black’s rooks and knights have only one move apiece, Black’s pieces cannot use the b-file, nor can he transfer pieces to the kingside. However, Black’s position is solid enough: as we said, White still has to prove his advantage.
23.Re3 Nh7
24.Reb3 Bd7
25.Qa5 Qc8
26.Nf2 Bd8
27.Qc3 Ba4
Geller’s exceptionally tough, staunch defense deserves special mention. He has successfully driven back the queen, and largely neutralized White’s control of the b-file: on Rb7 he plays simply ...Re7, and the rook must either retreat or trade. Now White directs his knight, bishops and queen toward the king’s wing, forcing Black to divert his pieces from the b-file.

30.Bh3 Qc7

34.Qf3! ...
This move deserves its exclamation mark, and not just for itself, but also as the finishing touch to the game as a strategic entity. All the moves which follow are based on the quick transfer of pieces from one wing to the other; the same idea figures in the present threat of 35.Kg2! followed by the exchange on d7, the check on f6, and Rb1-h1, with unavoidable mate somewhere in the vicinity of h8.
34...Qd8
35.Rb7 Rxb7

81. Najdorf—Kotov

1.e4 ...
Initiating a war of nerves. This was the only game in the entire tournament that Najdorf opened with his king’s pawn, expecting (as he explained later) that Kotov would play the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian, for which White had prepared, a little surprise.
1...c6
After long thought, Kotov replied 1...c7-c6 — also the only time in the entire tournament that he deserted his Sicilian. Kotov proceeded to equalize completely by means of painstakingly accurate play, and then began considering how to gain the advantage ...

White has one small advantage, his queenside pawn majority; Black has an extra center pawn. This means that in an endgame the chances lie with White, whereas a complex fight with queens promises fully equal play for Black. With this in mind, Kotov should not have been so eager to exchange queens; also, 20...Nb8 and 21...Nc6 was a better idea than his 20...Nb6.

29.Kd3 ...
It is not clear whether Najdorf was willing to take a draw here, or simply wished to test his opponent’s intentions, but in any event after 29...Rd8+ his king would have had to retreat. Of course, the draw would hardly be forced, even after 30.Ke2 Rdc8; White could redeploy his knights to e3 and b3, and try to exploit his queenside preponderance. However, Black would retain powerful support points in the center for his knights — all in all, a stubborn fight would lie ahead.
After 29.Kd3, however, the game took an unexpected turn. Kotov, full of optimism and fighting spirit as usual, decided to push his center pawns, drive off the white king and secure d3. It is our opinion that this plan, even if it could be fully carried out, would not have been especially favorable to Black. However, pushing the e-pawn does deprive the knight on b6 of any chance to go to d5 after White’s c4-c5. On e6, the pawn performed an important function by protecting d5.

34.c5 Nd3
35.Rd1 Nf4+
An oversight which loses by force. However, 35...Ke6 would also have left Black with the inferior position, in view of 36.g3, with f2-f3 to follow.

7.0-0 ...
Before the play gets too lively in the center, White decides to secure his king. Black has other ideas: he wants to carry out the typical maneuver in this opening — ...c5xd4 and ...d7-d5— at once.
Szabo probably figured that Black could not play this before castling because of checks on the a4-e8 diagonal; but Euwe risked it anyway, and equalized.
7...cxd4

Only a player with exceptionally strong nerves could allow himself such opening play.

Szabo exchanges bishops too quickly; pressure on the diagonal with 11.Qa4 was necessary, with the following main variation: 11...Bxb5 12.Qxb5+ Qd7 13.Nxd5! exd5 14.Qb3 or 14.Qe2, when White maintains his lead in development.

85. Stahlberg—Szabo
(Grunfeld Defense)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 g6
3.Nc3 d5
4.Nf3 Bg7
5.Qb3 ...
Black needs ...c7-c5, which White seeks to prevent by applying pressure against the d-pawn, thereby forcing either ...c7-c6 or ...d5xc4. Numerous defensive tries failed to work for Black until Smyslov worked out the plan Black employs in this game.
5...dxc4
6.Qxc4 0-0
7.e4 Bg4
This, with the following moves, is the Smyslov System of the Grunfeld.
8.Be3 Nfd7
This apparently illogical move has its own logic and its own history. When the system first began to be played, 8...Nc6 was usual here; 9.d5 would be answered by the bishop capture at f3 (9...Bxf3), for example: 10.dxc6 b5!, or 10.gxf3 Ne5 11.Qe2 c6! Eventually, White started to get the upper hand in this; then Smyslov (and others) began introducing refinements. This process of “laboratory testing” resulted in the move 8...Nfd7, which combines two ideas: retaining the option of ...c7-c5, and putting pressure on the d-pawn. Now, for example, 9...Nb6 is threatened, and if the queen leaves the d-pawn’s protection, then 10...Bxf3 followed by 11...Bxd4.
There have been several tries here: 9.Nd2, or 9.Be2 Nb6 10.Qd3 followed by long castling, which leads to a double-edged game; or 9.e5, or 9.d5, or 9.Rd1 Nb6 10.Qb3. The conclusion was finally reached that it is better to retreat the queen to b3 before the knight chases it away.
Szabo replies with an extremely complicated variation involving an immediate ...c7-c5.
9.Qb3 c5
10.d5 ...
If the queen takes the b-pawn (10.Qxb7), Black first trades his queen’s bishop for White’s king’s knight (10...Bxf3 11.gxf3), and then plays 11...cxd4, abandoning his queen’s rook; one line is 12.Qxa8 dxc3 13.Qxa7 cxb2 14.Rb1 Nc6, and Black has a very strong attack on the king for the exchange. The text makes it very uncomfortable for the queen’s bishop, which now has the choice of taking on f3 (which would strengthen White’s center) or of remaining at its post, to face great peril after 11.Nd2.
10...Na6
11.Nd2 e6
Black appears to be locking his own bishop in an escape-proof cell; this is not mere whimsy, however, but the product of analysis which Szabo had already tested in a game from a previous tournament. For example: 12.h3 exd5 threatening 13...d4, and if 13.exd5, then 13...Bf5 14.g4 c4, clearing c5 for the knight, which lets the bishop retreat; if then 15.Qxc4 Ne5 is possible, and the bishop is freed once again.
12.d6 ...
White’s pawn has broken free of its support, and will soon be surrounded by the hostile army. A fierce battle erupts around it, but one may already predict that the advantage must swing to Black, whose pieces are all developed, and who has already castled.
12...Bd4
This move is justified by the variation 13.h3 (winning the bishop?!) 13...Bxe3 14.fxe3 Qh4 with mate! On the other hand, if White exchanges bishops himself (13.Bxd4 cxd4) and then plays 14.Nb5, Black has the unpleasant reply 14...Ndc5, followed by 15...e5. Black’s passed pawn on the d-file would be defended, and therefore a great deal stronger than White s; the black pieces would also be better placed.
13.Bxa6 ...
This secures c4 for his knight and wins a tempo for castling, but it also opens the b-file.
13...bxa6
14.Nc4 Rb8
15.Qc2 e5
16.Nd5 Qh4
17.0-0 Be6
18.g3 ...
Stahlberg’s characteristically negligent attitude towards the safety of his king. An outstanding tactician who knows how to put up a staunch defense, he has saved so many difficult positions that he sometimes simply ignores such weakenings as this. But his g2-g3 will soon be followed by f2-f3, and a cold wind will begin to blow along the second rank, now open from c- to h-file, which will prove most unhealthy for White’s king.
Had White played 18.Rae1 here, or 18.Ne7+ followed by 19.Rae1, his game would still have been far from lost; now it gets very difficult.
18...Qh5
19.f3 Bxd5
20.exd5 Nb6
21.Bxd4 exd4
Although it leaves Black with a protected passed pawn, White could not avoid this exchange, since there was no way to defend the bishop: 21.Rae1 allows 21...Nxc4 22.Qxc4 Rxb2, with a mate threat at h2 — that second-rank weakness already!
22.Nxb6 Rxb6!
22...axb6 was possible too, but Black wanted to keep the b-file open for attacking purposes.
Once again, 23.Qxc5 is impossible on account of 23...Rxb2 with a mate threat.
23.Rac1 Rxd6
24.Qxc5 Rxd5
25.Qxa7 d3

The second-rank threat dogs White’s every step: he cannot even think of taking the a6-pawn (26.Qxa6), in view of 26...Re8 with a swift end.

34.Qb3 h5
The point of this maneuver is to gain control of g3 — this will become clear after White’s forced reply.
35.h3 h4
36.f4 Qe7
Naturally White could not allow 36...Qf4, but now comes the decisive maneuver: 36...Qe7 threatens 37...Rd3 followed by 38...Qe3 or 38...Qe1, depending on White’s reply.
37.Rf3 Rd3

9.e3 0-0
10.Be2 a6
Black wants to retreat his bishop to d6: this secures it against possible pursuit by Nb5. However, if White had wanted to force this bishop to exchange itself for his queen’s knight, he could have played 11.a3; this would have given him much the better game, considering that he could then enforce c3-c4, with powerful pressure on the b- and c-files. So this variation cannot be recommended for Black.
11.0-0 Be6
12.Rac1 Bd6
13.Qc2 Rfd8
14.Na4 Ne7
Black’s last few moves have aimed at creating a chain of pawns and freeing his pieces from the defense of the pawns at d5 and c7.
15.Nc5 Bc8
Black is ready to play the final move to consolidate his position; but now comes an unexpected blow, bringing the combinative element into the game and completely altering the situation. The e-pawn travels from the third rank to the fifth, and brings about a series of favorable simplifications.
16.e4 ...
When one’s opponent is well developed, such moves generally are not even considered, since the d4-pawn is “irretrievably” weakened, while Black — well, what does he have to worry about, since he has no weaknesses? In our day, the concept of “weakness” has altered to such an extent that not just pawn structure, but the poor placement of just one piece can be a weakness.
16...Qg6
16...Bf4 would be met by 17.e5 Qc6 18.Nd2!, when 18...b6 would prove unprofitable for Black: 19.Nd3 Qxc2 20.Rxc2 Bxd2 21.Rxd2, reaching an ending similar to the one that occurs in the game, but with a much weaker c-pawn. And on 16...dxe4, the black queen turns out to be badly placed. A sample variation will indicate White’s advantage in the fast-paced piece play that ensues: 17.Nxe4 Qg6 18.Bd3 Bf5 19.Nh4 Qh5 20.Nxf5 Nxf5 21.Nxd6 Nxd6 22.Qxc7.
17.e5 ...
It would seem more logical to continue harrying the queen by 17.Bd3: for example, 17...Bxc5 18.Qxc5, or 17...dxe4 18.Bxe4 Bf5 19.Bxf5, and after the trading on f5 White wins the b-pawn. That’s probably what Boleslavsky intended to play, too, until he discovered that Black has the excellent defense 17...Bf4; so he changed his plan.
17...Qxc2
18.Rxc2 Bxc5
19.Rxc5 c6
A very interesting position has developed. White’s natural plan — the minority attack with a4, b4 and b5 — allows Black active counterplay if he exploits White’s weakness (the d-pawn), and perhaps carries out the maneuver ...b7-b6 and ...c6-c5.
Black, in turn, will find it profitable to maneuver his rook to support the pawn advance ...f7-f6. If he sticks to passive tactics on both wings, then his game is bound to become difficult.
At the moment, Black threatens 20...Bg4, trading off the knight, and thereby making it harder for his opponent to defend the d-pawn; this explains White’s next move.
20.Nd2 a5
Here Black ought to have struck at the d-pawn first by 20...Nf5: his ...a6-a5 would have had more point, after 21.Nb3 (21...a5). White could answer with 22.a4, but then comes 22...Bd7, inducing a new White weakness; if 22.Rd1 instead, then 22...a4 23.Nc1 g5!, with such possibilities as ...f7-f6 or ...Nf5-g7-e6.
Averbakh’s move prevents 21.b4, followed by Nd2-b3-c5; but we have seen how he could have achieved the same end using far more active means.
21.Rc3 ...
This rook was only passing through c5; now it gives place to the knight.
21...Rf8
22.Re1 g6
Black’s previous move didn’t pan out: he wanted to prepare 22...f6, and recapture on f6 with his rook, but now 22...f6 would be met by 23.e6!, when the white pawn is very strong. So Black reluctantly goes on the defensive.
23.Bd3 Bf5
24.Bf1 a4
25.h3 Bd7
26.f4 h5
It takes great skill indeed to induce Averbakh, a well-known endgame expert, to put all of his pawns on the same color squares as his bishop.

33.Bc2 Ke7
34.Ra3 Nf5
Black is very much opposed to advancing his pawn to b5; so he sends up a trial balloon, offering to let White take on f5 and thereby leave himself with knight versus a bad bishop. White, however, calmly retreats his knight to f3, obtaining maximum results. Thus, the a4-pawn draws the pawn to b5 after it, like string from a ball, and the c6-pawn must suffer in turn.
35.Nf3 b5
36.Rc3 Rac8
37.Bxf5 Bxf5
38.Rec1 Bd7
39.e6! would now have been the logical conclusion of a well-played endgame: whichever way-Black takes, the white knight goes to e5, with powerful pressure on both wings. Apparently, the variation 39...Kxe6 40.Ne5 Be8 41.Nxc6 Kd6 42.Ne5 Rxc3 43.Rxc3 f6 44.Nd3 Bd7 appeared insufficient to Boleslavsky, so he takes his time.
39.Ne1 Rb8
40.Nd3 ...
White has finally gotten what he was after: as soon as the knight reaches c5, Black’s game will be nearly hopeless, since White will have an extra king-side pawn, practically speaking, and must eventually convert it into a win. Nevertheless, the move played gives Averbakh a problem-like save!
40...b4
41.Rc5 ...
Once again the rook is forced to occupy the square c5 where White had wanted to place his knight.
41...Bf5
42.Nf2 ...
Hoping to force the bishop’s retreat, after which the knight can support the advance g3-g4, but —
42...b3
In his difficult position, Averbakh finds a brilliant maneuver to set up a drawn position. If 43.axb3, then 43...Rxb3 44.Rxc6 Rxb2 45.Rc7+ Kf8, and White cannot win. Of 43.Rxc6, of course, there follows 43...bxa2 or 43...a3!, and suddenly it is Black who wins.
43.a3 Bc2
The picture has suddenly altered: the weak b-pawn has become strong, and the “bad” bishop now occupies a strong position. There would be no point for White in taking the c-pawn: 44.Rxc6 Rhc8 45.Rxc8 Rxc8 threatens 46...Rc4, and if White brings his king up to defend with 46.Kf3, then 46...Be4+ wins for Black. If the king were at f1, let’s say, then White could get to e3 via e2 and win. Thus, the ability to note and exploit the tiniest of nuances sometimes decides the outcome of a game.
The following maneuvers can no longer alter the result. The question arises: was the win ever possible? And if so, when did White let it slip?
On move 40, instead of Nd3, 40.Rc5! should have been played, not allowing Black two tempi for ...b4 and ...Bf5; then, on 40...b4, he could have replied 41.Ra5; or if 40...Rhc8 41.Nd3, and now if 41...Bf5 42.Nb4, or if 41...b4, then 42.Ra5, threatening 43.Nc5. It seems to me that Black, in spite of all his resourcefulness, would have been unable to save the game then.

87. Kotov—Petrosian
(Old Indian Defense)
We should like to draw the reader’s attention to the d4-pawn in this game: doubled, isolated, and surrounded by enemy pieces, still it showed an exceptional vitality. Such pawns were nonexistent in the games of Morphy, Steinitz, Lasker, Capablanca or Alekhine: they made their debut in contemporary grandmaster games, further enriching the treasury of ideas.
Such pawns appear not only in the King’s Indian, but also in the Sicilian Defense after 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 g6 5.c4 Bg7 6.Be3 Nf6 7.Nc3 Ng4 8.Qxg4 Nxd4 9.Qd1 e5! 10.Bd3 0-0 11.0-0 d6 12.Ne2 Be6 13.Nxd4 exd4, and in some other openings as well.
The d-pawn’s survivability depends, first and foremost, upon the fianchettoed king’s bishop, without which it would be a mere passing fancy; and secondly, upon how effectively Black exploits the open lines adjoining the pawn. And, in fact, such were the themes of the Kotov - Petrosian game.
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 d6
3.Nc3 Nbd7
4.e4 e5
5.Nf3 Be7
6.g3 ...
This is the proper strategy. White begins with the idea that a similar position — except for White’s c-pawn at c2 — could arise in the Philidor; there, the bishop would stand on c4, where it plays a leading role in the attack on the king. Here, however, at e2 or d3 it would only interfere with the rooks’ actions on the central files. On g2, however, it has an excellent future, since Black will have to cede the d4 square to White eventually, and then the e-pawn will become mobile.
6...0-0
7.Bg2 c6
8.0-0 a6
9.b3 ...
A rather patchwork idea. White is apparently anticipating ...b7-b5 by overprotecting c4, but then he brings his knight to d2 so that it may recapture on c4: nor is fianchettoing the queen’s bishop particularly favorable with a knight on c3. 9.h3 ought to have been played at once, securing e3 for the bishop and thereby strengthening d4.
9...Re8
10.Bb2 Bf8
11.Qd3 ...
11.Qc2 and 12.Rad1 was more natural. Why expose the queen to knight harassment from c5 or e5 ?
11...b5
12.Nd2 ...
Kotov never leaves a plan half-carried out, even when he begins to suspect the plan he has chosen may not have been very good. Here he feels that after 12...exd4 13.Qxd4 c5 would be bad for Black, since it would leave White’s knight the d5 square in perpetuity; meanwhile, White is preparing an eventual f2-f4. However, Black comes up with a deeply thought out forcing maneuver, leading to the seizure of the d4 square and the appearance of the “hardy” pawn.
12...Bb7
12...Qb6 was also possible here, when White would appear to have nothing better than 13.Ne2; but then the question arises: wouldn’t the knights have been better developed to d2 and e2 in the first place?
13.Kh1 ...
White wants to play f2-f4, but he can’t do it right away in view of 13.f4? exd4 14.Qxd4 d5!, with the threat of 15...Bc5. The king’s retreat does not prevent Black from carrying out his intended maneuver, so some sort of developing move, for instance 13.Rae1, was preferable here.
13...exd4
14.Qxd4 c5
Occupying d5 will be favorable for White if he can secure his knight there or if a trade of minor pieces on that square leaves him with a tangible advantage. In the present instance, neither condition holds, so Petrosian is therefore not afraid to weaken d5. White’s queen is forced to beat a slow retreat back into its own camp, with the black knight in hot pursuit.
15.Qd3 ...
After the queen retreats to e3 (15.Qe3), 15...d5 is possible.
15...Ne5
16.Qc2 Nc6
17.Nd5 Nd4
Black uses combinative means to secure a positional advantage: his next move, 18...g6, is an important link. Petrosian had to see all this before playing 13...exd4, or else his position would have been quite dubious by this time.
18.Qd3 g6
19.Bxd4 ...
Kotov doesn’t quite believe his opponent, so he takes the knight, hoping to be able to capture the d-pawn later. The more restrained 19.Nf3 would lead to a small advantage for Black: 19...bxc4 20.bxc4 Bxd5! 21.cxd5 Nxf3 22.Bxf3 Bg7, or 21.exd5 Nxf3 22.Qxf3 Bg7 23.Bxf6 Bxf6.
19...cxd4
20.Nxf6+ Qxf6
21.Kg1 Qe5
22.Rfe1 Bg7
23.Rac1 ...
White needs only to bring one of his rooks to d1 in order to win the d4-pawn, but Black has set up such fierce pressure on the c4- and e4-pawns that both rooks are occupied defending them. The plan to win the hardy pawn is not working out, and White’s game is hanging by a thread, but Kotov’s coolheaded defense stems the tide.
23...Re7
24.Nf3 Qc5
25.Bf1 h6
26.cxb5 Qxb5
27.Qd1 Qb6
28.Nd2 Rae8
29.Bd3 ...
The hardy pawn defies all its foes! Not a single piece can attack it, since it takes all of them put together to keep it blockaded. Now it is White’s game that looks suspect (29...d5 is a threat), but Kotov finds a courageous pawn sacrifice..
29...d5
30.e5 Rxe5
31.Rxe5 Rxe5
32.Nf3 ...
Now the bishop on b7 is firmly entombed, and the two d-pawns turn out to be weaker than one. Black would be more than willing to remove either of them from the board.
32...Re4
Petrosian makes one last attempt: an exchange sacrifice, which Kotov of course declines.
33.Qd2 a5
DRAW
Black has difficulty activating his bishops, and White has counterchances, too: a potential passed pawn, and control of the c-file.
Black had so good a position before his 29th move that one feels impelled to speculate as to whether or not he might have had a win.

7.Nb3 Be6
8.0-0 Nbd7
9.f4 Qc7
10.f5 Bc4
11.a4! ...
Against this system, a frequently used one by Najdorf, Geller has prepared a plan to occupy the light squares in the center and on the king’s wing. By pushing his pawn to f5, he has driven the bishop to c4, where it will shortly be traded off. Now he plays 11.a4 in order to restrict Black’s queenside play.
11...Rc8
12.Be3 Be7
12...d5 13.exd5 Bb4 or 13.Nxd5 Nxd5 14.exd5 Bxb3 15.cxb3 Bc5 was more in the spirit of this variation.
13.a5 h5
Najdorf is temperamentally unsuited to a passive game without counterchances. Seeing that his queenside pieces have been hemmed in, he undertakes a kingside diversion, aimed chiefly against the possibility of g2-g4. In a later game, he castled here and held the balance — not because his game was good, but rather thanks to his tactical skill.
14.Bxc4 Qxc4
15.Ra4 Qc7
16.h3 h4
17.Rf2 ...
17...b5
Najdorf confidently sacrifices a pawn for a little initiative. His position after the 18th move would indeed have been promising, had Geller taken the a-pawn; but Geller finds a steadier solution to the problem, as we shall see. Denying himself the material, he acquires a great positional advantage instead by a series of fine moves. And although Najdorf gave his 17...b5 an exclamation mark, it is possible that 17...Qc6 was better.
18.axb6 Nxb6
19.Bxb6 ...
This exchange is aimed at subjugating the light squares, especially d5, since White removes one of the pieces which could defend that square. The next links of his plan will be to bring the rook from f2 to a1, assail the a-pawn with his heavy pieces, tie down Black’s rooks and queen to its defense, and finally to bring his knight on b3 to e3, and then to d5.
The first part of this plan takes until move 24, the second part from move 25 to move 27, and the third part is concluded with White’s 31st move.
19...Qxb6
20.Qe2 Ra8
21.Kh2 0-0
22.Rf1 Ra7
23.Rfa1 Rfa8
24.R1a2 ...
Geller is playing an orthodox game to a fault. Here, he protects the b-pawn, in order to free his knight on b3, although he could also have played 24.Qd3, followed by 25.Nd2, when the b-pawn could not have been taken, in view of 26.Rb1. Now White enters the second part of his plan.
24...Bd8
25.Na5 Rc8
26.Nc4 Qc6
27.Ne3 a5
28.Rc4 Qa6
29.b3 Bb6
30.Rxc8+ Qxc8
31.Ned5 Nxd5
32.Nxd5 ...
The apotheosis of White’s strategy: Geller now holds the keys to Black’s castle.
32...Qc5
33.Ra1 ...
One must always be alert: Qg1 mate was threatened.
33...Qf2
There was the chance of 33...a4 34.bxa4 Rxa4; however, White would have played 34.Qg4 instead, winning as follows:
I. 34...axb3 35.f6 g6 36.Qxh4;
II. 34...Qf2 35.f6 Qg3+ 36.Qxg3 hxg3+ 37.Kxg3 axb3 38.Rxa7 Bxa7 39.cxb3.
34.Qxf2 ...
A quicker method was 34.Qg4 Bd8 35.b4 a4, leading to lines covered in the previous note; or even 35.Ra4 and 36.Rc4 or 36.b4. However, Geller wants no complications, not even favorable ones, intending to win this game in positional style.
34...Bxf2
35.Rf1 Bd4
If the bishop checks, it will never be able to escape from g3.
36.c3 Bc5
37.g4 hxg3+
38.Kxg3 Rb7
39.Rb1 f6
A classic endgame, with instructional value. The pawns are on squares of their own bishop’s color, the knight occupies a powerful position in the center of the board, and the light squares are accessible to the king. There remains only to create an outside passed pawn.
40.Kf3 Kf7
41.Ke2 Rb8
42.b4 g6
43.Kd3 ...
Geller carries his avoidance of combinative play to extremes. 43.fxg6+ would have won in a few moves: 43...Kxg6 44.bxc5 Rxb1 45.c6 Rb8 46.c7 Ra8 47.c8=Q Rxc8 48.Ne7+.

91. Reshevsky—Bronstein
(King’s Indian)
This game had some influence on the placement of the leaders, since I stood 1½ points behind Reshevsky, and a win for me would decrease that gap to half a point. If Reshevsky, who was undefeated so far, were to win, he would catch up to Smyslov. So it would appear that a draw suited none of us three. (All of these ruminations may be considered as part of the pregame warmup.)
The opening was a well-known King’s Indian, with both sides striving for the initiative. The second phase (up to move 23) was mostly maneuvering; by its close, a black pawn had appeared on a3, and a white one on e5. In the following phase, White tried to cash in his initiative in the center and kingside for a mating attack, inventing a remarkable combination which sacrificed a pawn, a rook, and the exchange — which Black neutralized by exchanging off the enemy knight. A series of exchanges followed, which laid bare the deficiencies of Reshevsky’s pawn-pushing.
Queens plus opposite-colored bishops usually means a very sharp fight. In the game’s concluding phase Black kept up his mating attack until the very last move, unwilling to trade queens anywhere except at b2, which would have been hopeless for White.
Even after all this, it still seemed as though Black might not get his win. He found it, however, by means of a joint maneuver by queen, bishop and pawn that left the white pieces in a state of absolute zugzwang.

White attacked the d-pawn, but after Black’s reply, he sees that the pawn could be recovered favorably by (16.Rxd6) 16...Ne5, when 17.b3 would only make matters worse in view of the surprising stroke 17...Bxh3, since taking the bishop (18.Bxh3) would allow the check on f3 (18...Nf3+).
16.Bf1 Ne5
17.Nd4 a3
18.f4 ...
Making this active move, Reshevsky offered a draw, although it would appear he was in a fighting mood, and would probably have been quite upset if I had accepted the offer. His inquiry, “Are you playing for a win?” appears to be more in the nature of a probe designed to needle his opponents into some precipitate step.

A key move, justifying Black’s entire strategy in this phase. It is very important that the white knight be kept out of f6. The e5-pawn could not have been taken by the bishop (27...Bxe5), since White would have replied 28.Rxe5 and then taken the rook on d8; but now White must give serious consideration to the defense of the e-pawn.
28.Rde4 Bh6

30.g5 ...
Initiating the combination. Reshevsky clears f4 for his rook, which clears a spot in turn for his knight.
30...Bg7
31.Rf4 Bf5
32.Ne4 ...
White offers the e5-pawn. I was quite tempted to take it, meeting the obvious knight check by sacrificing my queen for rook, knight and pawn. Black’s pieces would have acquired tremendous scope, with good prospects for the further strengthening of my position.
However, Reshevsky had prepared a diabolical combination in answer to the pawn capture:
32...Qxe5? 33.Rxf5, and now:
a) 33...Qxf5 34.Nf6+ Bxf6 35.Rxe8+ Rxe8 36.Qxe8+ Kg7 37.gxf6+
b) 33...gxf5 34.Nf6+ Bxf6 35.gxf6!! Qxe3 36.Qg2 — check and mate.
The beauty of this combination lies in the second line, in which White, already a rook down by move 35, captures, not the queen, but the bishop with a pawn, creating an irresistible threat of mate.
32...Bxe4+
White’s volley has missed its mark.
33.Rfxe4 Na6
34.e6 fxe6
Here Reshevsky offered another draw — and this time, I believe he meant it.
Black’s position deserves the nod: his a3-pawn is strong, the white king is exposed, and the black knight is better than the bad white bishop.

White would very much like to capture the b-pawn, but this would lead to an immediate loss, surprisingly enough, thanks to a rare circumstance: the king drives the queen back here! — 44.Qxb7+? Kd8 45.Qa8+ Kc7 46.Qa5+ Bb6, when the queen is
en prise
and mate is threatened at g1.
Nonetheless, the check on move 43 was useful for White: it brought Black’s king out to e7, so that now Black’s queen may not move to f2 (44...Qf2) in view of 45.Qe2+, trading queens for a clear draw.

Neither player can afford to initiate the trade of queens. If White takes on b2, then Black needs only to create one more passed pawn on the kingside to win; while if Black takes on e2, the most he will ever be able to achieve will be the capture of white’s a-pawn. But this would still not be enough to win for him, since at that moment the white king would turn up at c2, incarcerating its colleague.

The last reserves enter the fray.

There’s our zugzwang. Seeing no way out, Reshevsky allowed his flag to fall, upon which he was scored a loss.
ROUND FOURTEEN
92. Gligoric—Reshevsky
(Ruy Lopez)
The first twenty moves in this game were right out of theory, and the players added very little of their own to the handbook. It might seem rather dull to the reader, but it does liven up a little when Gligoric offers his queen for rook and bishop on the 29th move. Despite the fact that the resulting balance of forces would favor Black arithmetically, Reshevsky declined this sacrifice.
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 0-0 9.h3 Na5 10.Bc2 c5 11.d4 Qc7 12.Nbd2 Bd7 13.Nf1 Rfe8 14.dxe5 dxe5 15.N3h2 g6 16.Ne3 Be6 17.Nhg4 Nxg4 18.hxg4 Rad8 19.Qf3 Nc4 20.Nd5 Bxd5 21.exd5 Nb6 22.Be4 c4 23.Bd2 Rd6 24.Rad1 Red8
Both sides continue their leisurely woodshifting: neither wants to rock the boat.
25.Be3 Na4 26.Rd2 a5 27.a3 Nc5 28.g5 f5 29.gxf6 Rxf6
30.Bxc5 Qxc5
Had Black taken the queen (30...Rxf3), 31.Bxe7 Qxe7 32.Bxf3 would have ensued; now the passed d-pawn would have to be blockaded, but with no more minor pieces at hand, Black would be forced to assign his only rook to the task, leaving White’s rooks to pile up on the isolated e-pawn. In this line Black could hope for no more than a draw.
31.Qe3 Qc7 32.Bf3 Bd6 33.Qh6 Qg7 34.Qxg7+ Kxg7
DRAW
93. Taimanov—Keres
(Queen’s Gambit)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6
3.Nc3 d5
4.Bg5 c5
Keres, who stands apart from King’s Indianophiles and Nimzolovers alike, has secretly prepared a system for this tournament involving ...c7-c5 at a very early stage of the Queen’s Gambit Declined, and employed it successfully against Stahlberg and Geller, and in the last round against Najdorf as well, in reply to 4.Nf3.
5.e3 ...
A practical game is no theoreticians’ polemic. Taimanov was undoubtedly aware that after 5.cxd5 theory finds an advantage for White in every variation from “a” to the end of the alphabet — and as a matter of fact, he had won a game himself using precisely that line against Prins at Stockholm 1952. But as Taimanov, who has studied the 5.cxd5 variation extensively, also knows, the last word has not been said here either. So he chooses another line.
Really, is it possible to “prove” that 4...c5 is contrary to the logic of chess with such lines as these:
a) 5.cxd5 cxd4 6.Qxd4 Be7 7.e4 Nc6 8.Qe3 Nxd5 9.exd5 Bxg5 10.f4 Nb4 11.0-0-0 Be7 12.dxe6 Qc7 13.exf7+ Kxf7 14.Nf3 Nxa2+; or
b) 5.cxd5 cxd4 6.Qxd4 Be7 7.e4 Nc6 8.Qd2 exd5 9.Bxf6 Bxf6 10.exd5 Ne5 11.Bb5+ etc.; or
c) 5.cxd5 cxd4 6.Qxd4 Be7 7.e4 Nc6 8.Qd2 Nxe4 9.Nxe4 exd5 10.Bxe7 Qxe7 11.Qxd5 0-0 12.f3 Nb4 13.Qg5 etc.
Note too that after 5.cxd5 Black may try the so-called Peruvian Variation: 5...Qb6 6.Bxf6 Qxb2 etc.
The most precise knowledge of opening theory cannot guarantee one against over-the-board surprises. Therefore, a grandmaster will frequently avoid the “best” continuation in favor of his own, whether accepted by theory or not.
5...cxd4
6.exd4 Be7
7.Nf3 0-0
8.Rc1 ...
A waste of time. White is dallying with the development of his kingside pieces, although the game is now semi-op en, which means that White must take care to get his king secured. The more natural move here was 8.Bd3.
8...b6!
9.Bd3 Nc6
10.0-0 Nb4
11.cxd5! ...
A positional snare. If Black succumbs and takes the bishop — 11...Nxd3 12.Qxd3 exd5 — then 13.Ne5 gives White a clear advantage: on e5 the knight is better than either bishop. White could; have laid a tactical snare as well: 11.Ne5, and if Black takes the bishop (11...Nxd3), 12.Nc6 Qd7 13.Nxe7+ Qxe7 14.Qxd3 Ba6 15.b3 would lead to a lively game with about even chances. The swindle appears if, instead of 12...Qd7, Black tries to snatch a pawn in passing with 12...Nxb2 13.Qe2 Qd7 14.Nxe7+ Qxe7 15.Qxb2 Ba6. White would not take the knight on move 15, but a doubly defended pawn instead: 15.Nxd5, and Black’s position would collapse. Black would have to settle for the first variation: 11.Ne5 Nxd3 12.Qxd3 Bb7, since an immediate 11...Bb7 12.Bb1 would leave White good attacking prospects against g7 and h7.
11...Nfxd5
12.Bxe7 Qxe7
13.Be4 Bb7
14.Rfe1 Rac8
15.Qd2 h6
Both a prophylactic and a waiting move. Minor piece trades impend: White wishes to induce ...Nxc3, so that he can recapture with a pawn and thereby strengthen his d-pawn; Black goes along with this, since the whole pawn constellation will not be any stronger for it. There’s no need to hurry with this exchange, however, since it can just as well be played after 16.a3.
16.a3 Nxc3
17.Bxb7 Qxb7
18.bxc3 Nc6
19.Qd3 Rfd8
The classic starting position for an attack against the hanging c- and d-pawns. White must weigh concretely his opponent’s threats against his own means for coping with them. In the event White continues passively, Black has several attacking options:
a) Nc6-a5-c4, blockading the c-pawn and pressing on the a-pawn;
b) rook maneuvers on the c-and d-files;
c) undermining the d-pawn by means of ...b6-b5, ...a7-a5,and ...b5-b4.
Black’s final plan will depend quite a bit on White’s counterplay: whether he settles into a bunker defense, or carries the play to the center with c3-c4 and d4-d5, or attacks the black king.
Taimanov puts off the decision for a move while he opens a vent for his king.
20.h3 Rc7
21.Re4 ...
A bold idea. Objectively, it may be that 21.c4 was stronger, but Taimanov does not feel he could defend the hanging c- and d-pawns against a Keres; so he decides to base his defense on the pawn at c3, simultaneously preparing an attack on the king’s wing.
21...Na5
22.Nd2 ...
Of course it was more appealing to move the knight up: 22.Ne5, but this would have cost the exchange.
22...Qd5
Keres insists on inviting c3-c4, since he now threatens to invade at a2. Taimanov, however, is not to be put off his plan, even though by now c3-c4 has become necessary.
23.Rg4 ...
White has found a vulnerable spot in Black’s fortress — g7. Now he wants to attack it twice, following the precepts of chess pedagogy: rook first, queen after. He also threatens the primitive 24.Rxg7+, 25.Qg3+ and 26.Qxc7, as well as 24.Ne4.
Some idea of how dangerous the situation could become for Black, should he try to avoid weakening his pawn structure, might be gleaned from the variation 23...Nc4 24.Ne4 Ne5 25.Qg3 Nxg4 26.Qxc7 (the rook sacrifice on g7 could boomerang on White here: 25.Rxg7+ Kxg7 26.Qg3+ Ng6! 27.Qxc7 Qxe4! 28.Qxd8 Nf4, forcing mate).
23...f5
24.Rg3 Rdc8
Black is not going to be able to break in c3 without the use of his pawns, so the rook move is useless. 24...e5 would have been the proper conclusion to Black’s strategy, torpedoing the central d4-pawn. A careful examination of the variations proceeding from 25.Qxf5 exd4 will convince us that all of them wind up favoring Black. But now the rook on g3 returns to the e-file, fixing Black’s newly-created weakness on e6, and the rook’s sojourn from e1 to e4 to g4 to g3 to e3 is justified at last.
25.Re3 Nc4
Black goes overboard in his efforts to simplify and win by means of pure technique. If Keres wanted to continue playing for the win, he had to test White with either 25...Qd6 or 25...Qa2.
26.Nxc4 Rxc4
27.Qd2 ...
27...Qc6
It’s hard for Black to hold his e-pawn, since White has, besides a direct attack on the pawn, the continual threat to break with Re5 and d4-d5. Keres decides to trade the e-pawn for white’s c-pawn, but he chooses a bad moment to do it: better to have played 27...R8c6 first, and then to have retreated his queen to d7, or even to d6.
For a more general evaluation of such positions, the reader should bear in mind that, were Black’s pawn at f7 instead of f5, White would be in dire straits after the maneuver ...b6-b5, ...a7-a5 and ...b5-b4.
28.Rce1 Rxc3
29.Rxe6 Qc4
30.Qf4 Rc1
White’s pieces are now very active, and Black has a hard time spotting all White’s possible plans in time to neutralize them. Here, for example, 31.Re8+ was threatened. So Black first reduces the number of pieces on the board.
31.Qxf5 Qxd4
32.Rxc1 Rxc1+
33.Kh2 ...
In a queen-and-heavy-pieces game, the first thing that must be seen to is the protection of the king, since the side which can combine the advance of its pawns with threats to the opposing king will hold the initiative in such endings. In this position, White’s advantage boils down to his having more pawns on the f- and h-files, with the f-pawn being especially important, as it shields the king from checks on the diagonal h2-b8. The difference in the positions of the respective kings is clearly visible from the diagram.
33...Qd7
34.Qe4 ...
34...Rc8
Keres must now play a dogged defense, and he does it with skill.
35.f4 Rf8
36.Qe5 ...
Inviting his opponent to try the pawn-down rook ending with 36...Rxf4 37.Re7 Qd4 38.Rxg7+ Kh8 39.Qxd4 Rxd4 40.Rxa7. Black could probably have gotten a draw by trading off all of the queen-side pawns, but Keres didn’t want to risk it, since he thought he could stop White’s attack by simpler means — which, as unfortunately happens so often, turned out to be more complex.
36...Qd2
Keres assumed that the f-pawn could not be defended, for example: 37.Kg3 Qd3+; but he overlooked the fact that advancing the pawn would secure the g6 square for White, and create a new possibility of attacking the g7-pawn. He would have been better off attacking the pawn from the other side: 36...Qf7, which also attacks the f5 square; if then 37.g3 Qf5.
37.f5 Qa5
In fierce time-pressure, Keres could not risk 37...Rf7 38.Re8+ Kh7 39.Qb8 Rxf5, and decided to double his queenside pawns. That could have cost him the· game.
38.Qxa5 bxa5
39.g4 ...
By defending his f-pawn again, Taimanov slackens his initiative for a moment and exposes his king; the latter circumstance allows Keres to create a threat to the white a-pawn and force the draw. With the more active continuation 39.Re5, Taimanov would have retained his plus pawn in all lines, with real winning chances.
39...Rb8
The rook makes for the open sea; since the pawns are dead even, White’s advantage has completely evaporated.

96. Averbakh—Kotov
(Old Indian Defense)
The most beautiful game of the Zurich tournament, this game has drawn rave reviews from the entire chess world. “Once in a hundred years..”, “Unique in chess literature..”, “Exquisite queen sacrifice..” — such were the feelings of commentators of many lands, although none of them could match the reaction in the tournament hall. To this we may add that the Averbakh - Kotov game now has a spot in the golden treasury of chess art.
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 d6
3.Nf3 Nbd7
4.Nc3 e5
5.e4 Be7
6.Be2 ...
In the previous round, Petrosian had used a similar defense against Kotov and obtained good play. In this tournament, Kotov generally answered 1.d4 with 1...d5, or else played the King’s Indian; for this game, however, he adopted Petrosian’s idea, employing it impromptu against Averbakh.
In the previous game, White had continued 6.g3, fianchettoing his bishop; here Averbakh uses the other method of developing it, 6.Be2. This would make sense if he followed it up with an advance of his queenside pawns, but he does not carry his plan through to its logical conclusion.
6...0-0
7.0-0 c6
8.Qc2 Re8
9.Rd1 Bf8
10.Rb1 a5
11.d5! ...
The immediate 11.a3 would have been a poor idea, since Black would have exchanged in the center, exposing the e-pawn, and then advanced his a-pawn, preventing b2-b4.
11...Nc5
12.Be3 Qc7
13.h3 Bd7
14.Rbc1 g6
15.Nd2 Rab8
This position is one of dynamic equality, requiring great skill from both sides. Black can undertake a diversion on either the queenside (for example, ...Rec8, ...cxd5 and ...b5) or the kingside (...Kh8, ...Ng8 and ...f5). Neither would present any deadly danger to White, provided he takes preventive measures. The only danger would be that he might allow himself to become so wrapped up in meeting the threats on one wing as to miss the critical moment on the other.
16.Nb3 Nxb3
17.Qxb3 c5
This move is the equivalent of an announcement, with fanfares, that Black has chosen the kingside as his main theater of operations. White should now have lost no time preparing a2-a3 and b2-b4: for example, 18.Qc2 Kh8 19.a3 Ng8 20.Bg4, and if 20...Nf6, he can trade bishops and open the b-file.
18.Kh2 Kh8
19.Qc2 Ng8
20.Bg4 Nh6
21.Bxd7 ...
Since White here declines a possible repetition of the position (21.Be2 Ng8), evidently he feels his chances are not inferior. He is correct, inasmuch as he has the possibility of playing a2-a3, Rb1 and b2-b4; but he is also incorrect, inasmuch as he has something totally different in mind.
21...Qxd7
22.Qd2 Ng8
23.g4 ...
Averbakh is trying to put out the fire with gasoline. Now ...f7-f5 comes with double force, since Black can capture either of two pawns, while neither white pawn may capture on f5.
23...f5
24.f3 Be7
25.Rg1 Rf8
26.Rcf1 Rf7
27.gxf5 ...
Although many commentators gave this move a question mark, it cannot be considered a mistake; actually, it is the continuation of a plan begun much earlier. Averbakh intends an attack along the g-file, and so he opens it. This is all very logical — except that the h-pawn has to be on h2.
27...gxf5
28.Rg2 f4
29.Bf2 Rf6
30.Ne2 ...
The creative element of chess is generally thought to consist of three things: logic, accurate calculation, and technique (this last includes a knowledge of theory). There is a fourth ingredient also, however, perhaps the most intriguing of all, although it is often overlooked. I refer to intuition — chess fantasy, if you prefer.
Occasionally a position arises in the course of a game which cannot be evaluated on general principles, such as pawn weaknesses, open lines, better development, etc., since the state of equilibrium has been upset on several counts, rendering an exact weighing of the elements impossible. Attempting to calculate the variations doesn’t always work, either. Imagine that White has six or seven different continuations, and Black five or six replies to each move; it’s easy to see that no genius on earth could reach even the fourth move in his calculations. It is then that intuition or fantasy comes to the rescue: that’s what has given the art of chess its most beautiful combinations, and allowed chessplayers the chance to experience the joy of creating.
It is not true to say that intuitive games were only played in the days of Morphy, Anderssen and Chigorin (as if now, in our era, everything were to be based totally on positional principles and rigorous calculation!; I remain convinced that, even in the games which received the brilliancy prizes at this tournament, not all of the variations were calculated to the end. Intuition has been arid remains one of the cornerstones of chess creativity — of which we shall now see proof positive.
30...Qxh3+
Now the weakness of the pawn at h3 tells. The point of Kotov’s remarkable combination, which all his previous play went to prepare, is to drag the white king out to f5, where it will be defenseless against Black’s two rooks, knight and bishop; while White’s five pieces, deep in his rear echelon, can only look on from afar.
31.Kxh3 Rh6+
32.Kg4 Nf6+
33.Kf5 ...
Like a rabbit hypnotized by a python, the king advances unwillingly to the place of its doom. For an understanding of the next phase of the game, bear in mind that Kotov had very little time left until the time control, and naturally did not wish to spoil such a beautiful and unusual game with some hasty move. Therefore, he decides to give a few checks, in order to get the game past the 40th move and adjourn it. No doubt, there has to be mate in this position; most probably, Kotov saw its basic outlines as far back as his 30th move.
33...Nd7
Here’s the proof: had the queen sacrifice been “accurately calculated”, Kotov would instead have chosen Stahlberg’s postmortem suggestion, 33...Ng4, depriving White of the reply 34.Rg5. After 33...Ng4, White would have had to suffer colossal material losses in order to avert the mate threats.
34.Rg5 ...
The only defense against the threatened mate in three: ...Rf8, ...Rg8 and ...Rf6.

35.Kg4 Nf6+

43.Kg4 Bxg5
Black threatens 44.-- 44...Be7, 45.-- followed by 45...Nf6+ 46.Kf5 Nd7+ 47.Kg4 Rg8+ and mate next move. White has two tempi in which to organize his defense, but cannot do anything with them, since all communications between the upper and lower halves of the board are either severed by pawn barricades or under the crossfire of Black’s pieces. Relatively “best” was 44.Be3 Be7 45.Bxf4 exf4 46.Nxf4 Rh4+ 47.Kg3 Rhxf4, but even this best would also have been quite hopeless for White.
44.Kxg5 ...
44...Rf7
The threat is mate in two moves by ...Rg7+ and ...Rf6; 45.Nxf4 Rg7+ 46.Ng6+ Rgxg6+ 47.Kf5 Ne7 is mate too. White must give up still another piece.

The logical continuation of White’s opening plan was to play to retain the pawn with 8.Nb3 0-0 9.Be3. Now Black is better developed, and will shortly recover the c-pawn.

Black has the better of it. Here is a curious combination which might occur: 18...Re8 19.Qd2 Ne4 20.Qxd5? Nxf2! 21.Qxd6 Nxd1+ 22.Qxb6 Re1 mate.
98. Euwe—Stahlberg
(Grunfeld Defense)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 g6
3.g3 c6
Black meets the flank development of the bishop by advancing his c-pawn to support ...d7-d5, setting up a symmetrical position with a fixed pawn structure. Stahlberg is challenging Euwe the openings theoretician, by making it very difficult for White to get an advantage.
Euwe does not try to refute the opening, which is impossible, but to upset the statistical balance and create livelier play, trusting that the advantage of the first move will make itself felt somewhere. Stahlberg is willing to meet Euwe halfway, and the game which results is very much like an absorbing novelette.
4.d5 cxd5
5.cxd5 d6
The sortie 5...Qa5+ 6.Nc3 Ne4 is insufficient, and meets a pretty refutation in 7.Qd4 Nxc3 8.Bd2 Qxd5 9.Qxc3!
6.Bg2 Bg7
7.Nc3 0-0
8.Nf3 Nbd7
It is not entirely clear where the knight is headed: there does not seem to be any clear path leading out of d7. First he should have let the bishop out: 8...Bg4 9.Nd4 Qc8!
9.0-0 Nb6
10.a4 ...
Like Tarrasch in his day, Euwe cannot abide the sight of an enemy knight on b6. But the knight stands so poorly on that square that there was no need to disturb it. The quiet 10.Nd4 and 11.b3 would have underscored the knight’s limited mobility, while the flank deployment of the second bishop would harmoniously complement the ensemble of white pieces.
Euwe intends to develop the bishop at e3: it must have been in order to rid himself of the temptation to advance the e-pawn.
10...Bg4
11.Nd4 a6
Here Stahlberg probably wanted to play 11...Qc8, but didn’t like 12.a5 Nc4 13.a6, when White gets the important square c6 for his knight.
12.h3 Bc8
13.b3 Bd7
Stahlberg did not retreat to d7 immediately, fearing 13.Qb3, when the attempt to take the d5-pawn would end very badly for Black: 12...Bd7 13.Qb3 Nfxd5 14.Nxd5 Bxd4 15.Bh6, and Black must cede the exchange, as otherwise White could threaten the knight at b6 and mate at g7 simultaneously, with serious difficulties for Black. And if, after 13.Qb3, Black does not take the d-pawn, but continues instead with 13...Qc7, 14.Be3 Nc4 15.Rfc1 sets up an unpleasant pin on the c-file.
Thus, the black bishop can find no fulcrum from which to exert its leverage, and wanders mournfully along the diagonal c8-h3: it has taken three moves to get from c8 to d7! That’s quite enough to induce White to start an attack: with 14.a5, the black knight would have been driven back to c8, where it interferes with the coordination of Black’s rooks, and would have had a lot more skulking about to do, too.
14.Be3 Rc8
15.Qd2 Rc5
Black is spoiling for a fight! Stahlberg was probably attracted less by the prospect of winning the pawn than by the piquant position of the rook on c5, a square where it would appear to be vulnerable, yet cannot be attacked. Evidently, he was not yet willing to sacrifice the rook for knight and pawn by 15...Rxc3 16.Qxc3 Nbxd5, but in his cramped position he could hardly hope to obtain anything better. Stahlberg still keeps the possibility of trading off the rook in this fashion for the next two moves, but he stubbornly maintains its position on c5.
16.Nc6 ...
A valiant charge! The knight may be taken by rook, bishop or pawn: which is best? Stahlberg follows the line of greatest resistance: instead of one minor piece for the rook, he gets two, but his opponent gets an extremely dangerous passed pawn. Other possible lines: 16...Bxc6 17.dxc6 Rxc3 18.Qxc3 Nfd5 19.c7; or 16...Nfxd5 17.Nxd8 Bxc3, etc.
In either case, White would retain the advantage.
16...bxc6
17.Bxc5 dxc5
18.dxc6 Be6
19.Qxd8 Rxd8
20.Rad1 Rc8
Black must not exchange rooks under any circumstances, but. he should have left c8 free for the knight by retreating the rook to e8.
21.a5 Na8
22.Na4 ...
Another pretty combination. Euwe invites the capture of his b-pawn (22...Bxb3), when there would follow 23.Nb6, and White either wins a piece or queens his pawn. Of course, Black declines that continuation, but the c-pawn will fall.
22...Nc7
23.Nxc5 Nfd5
Black sees that he must bring up his sleeping kingside pieces as quickly as possible, and to that end he sacrifices yet another pawn; however, such drastic measures were as yet unnecessary, 23...Nfe8 was better, intending ...Nd6 and ...Bc3.
24.Nxa6 Nxa6
25.Bxd5 Bxh3
It would have been tempting to trade off the bishops as well, picking up the c-pawn, but this would have led to a quick finish: one white rook would go to the eighth rank, while the other supported the advance of the b-pawn.
26.Bg2 Be6
Here too, he cannot exchange bishops, and for the same reason.
27.Rb1 Bc3
He ought to have found out where the rook intended to go after 27...Bf5: the choice was not great. Stahlberg apparently feared White would take a draw by repetition of moves, and he was loath to abandon a game that had proven so interesting...
28.Rfd1 Bb4
29.Rd4 Bf5
30.Rbd1 Bd6
31.Rc4 Be6
32.Bd5 Bxd5
33.Rxd5 ...
Black’s pointless maneuverings have allowed White to improve the positions of his pieces. One of Black’s drawing chances lay in avoiding an exchange of light-square bishops, which keeps the possibility of giving back the two pieces for the rook and pawn, leaving opposite-colored bishops. For this reason, he should have brought his lightsquare bishop to e6 only after the preparatory 31...Nc7.
33...Rb8
34.b4 ...
Three connected passed pawns can be a terrible weapon when they start rolling and smashing all before them. Cases are known in which such pawns have defeated two rooks, or even a queen and rook; so Stahlberg must take the b-pawn. He cannot take it with the rook, since after the last black rook is exchanged off, White plays Rd5-b5-b6 and then queens his a-pawn. Taking on b4 with the bishop would be bad too (34...Bxb4), in view of 35.c7. Luckily for Stahlberg, he can still wriggle out of his difficult situation by giving back the two pieces for rook and pawn to get into a slightly inferior rook endgame,
34...Nxb4
35.Rxd6 exd6
36.c7 Rc8
37.Rxb4 Rxc7
38.Ra4 ...
The game enters its third, and most interesting, phase.
The tale of chess tournaments has furnished us a wealth of material on the theory and practice of rook endgames; this endgame, played by both sides with a high degree of skill, certainly belongs among the best. Black’s task is a most difficult one; he has to cope with an outside passed pawn. He does have counterchances, however: the possibility of quickly creating a matching passed pawn on the h-file, and the fact that there is so little material left on the board. This latter circumstance sometimes allows one to trade off all his pawns, give up the rook for the last of the enemy pawns, and then force one’s opponent to repay his debt in the same coin.
We are largely indebted to Dr. Euwe’s analysis for the following commentaries.
38...Kf8
The king would be better brought via g7 and f6 to e5, but that doesn’t come off; 38...Kg7 39.Kg2 Kf6 40.Kf3 Ke5 41.a6 Ra7 42.Ra5+ d5 43.e4, and White wins a pawn. The reason this turns out in White’s favor is that the white rook stands behind its far-advanced pawn, and thus has freedom to maneuver; the same cannot be said of Black’s rook, which stands in front of the passed pawn and will have fewer and fewer squares as the pawn advances further. This is quite a basic element in the evaluation of rook endings, and will figure prominently in the struggle at hand.
39.Kg2 Ke7
40.Kf3 Kd7
41.Ke4 Ra7
42.Kd5 ...
If Black should succeed in creating a passed pawn on the h-file, things will not be so bad for him.
42...h5
43.f4 ...
Euwe already sees Black’s plan of ...f7-f6, ...g6-g5 and ...h5-h4, and wishes to keep in hand the possibility of creating an outpost at f5, thereby maintaining winning chances after a mutual liquidation of passed pawns.
43...Ra6
Here Euwe’s analysis indicates it would have been better to begin at once with the creation of a passed pawn by 43...f6, followed by:
I. 44.a6 g5 45.f5 h4 46.gxh4 gxh4
a) 47.Rxh4 Rxa6 48.Rh7+ Ke8 49.Ke6 d5+ 50.Kxd5 Ra5+, drawing;
b) 47.Ke4 Kc6 48.Kf4 Kb5 49.Ra3 Rxa6 50.Rxa6 Kxa6 51.Kg4 Kb5 52.Kxh4 Kc5, and the pawn ending is drawn, since the king gets back just in time to defend the pawn on f6;
II. 44.Ra3 g5 45.f5 h4 46.gxh4 gxh4 47.Ke4 h3 48.Kf3 d5 49.Kg3 Kd6 50.Kxh3 Ke5, drawing;
III. 44.e4 Ra6, with the same ideas as in the game, but with an extra tempo for Black.
44.e4 ...
He shouldn’t have taken the e4 square away from his king. This is important in the following variation: 44.Ra2 f6 45.Ra3 g5 46.f5 h4 47.gxh4 gxh4 48.Ke4 h3 49.Kf3 h2 50.Kg2 Kc6 51.Kxh2 Kb5 52.Kg3 Rxa5 53.Rxa5+ Kxa5 54.Kh4, and White picks up the f-pawn and queens one move before Black. The same thing occurs after 48...Kc6 49.Kf4 Kb5 50.Kg4 Rxa5 51.Rxa5+, etc. But now that a pawn bars the white king’s path, Black can go in for this variation — which, indeed, he does.
44...f6
45.Ra2 g5
46.f5 h4
47.gxh4 gxh4
48.Kc4 Ra8
The crux of this remarkable endgame, and in fact of the entire game. Stahlberg quite evidently thought that he could support his passed h-pawn in some lines; how could he have seen that it was precisely the paradoxical 48...Ra7 which would have held the draw? As Euwe shows in his analyses: 49.a6 Kc6, and now:
a) 50.Ra3 h3 51.Rxh3 Rxa6 52.Rh6 Kd7 53.Rh7+ Ke8 54.Kd5 Ra5+ 55.Kxd6 Re5 and draws;
b) 50.Kd4 h3 51.Ra3 h2 52.Ra1 Kd7 53.Kd5 h1=Q 54.Rxh1 Rxa6 55.Rh7+ Ke8 56.Ke6 d5+ 57.Kxd5 Ra5+ 58.Kd4 Re5 and draws.
With the rook at a8, white’s pawn goes to a7; then, in variation b), after the trade of pawns, White checks at h7 and wins the rook.
49.a6 Kc6
50.a7 h3
The attempt to trade passed pawns by 50...Kb7 51.Rh2 Rxa7 52.Rxh4 would lose for Black, since his king would not have the time to get back in order to defend his pawns: 52...Kc6 53.Rh6 Rf7 54.Rh8 Re7 55.Kd4 Rf7 56.Rg8, and Black is in zugzwang.
51.Kd4 Kc7
If Black had advanced his passed pawn to the second rank, White would not have taken it off at once, but given check from c2 first; with the black king confined to the b-file, White would have an easy win.
52.Kd5 Kd7
53.Ra3 h2
54.Ra1 ...
Underscoring all the shortcomings of Black’s position: now he has no useful move. For example, after 54...h1=Q 55.Rxh1 Rxa7 56.Rh7+, White wins the rook at a7. If Black prepares this by retreating his king to the eighth rank, White places his king in opposition, setting up a mate threat after the exchange of pawns. If 54...Ke7, then obviously 55.Kc6 and 56.Kb7. Black tries to play on for a while a pawn down, but that’s clearly hopeless.
54...Re8
55.Rh1 Re5+
56.Kd4 Ra5
57.Rxh2 Kc6
58.Rh7 Ra4+
Here Stahlberg might have given his opponent the opportunity to end the game with the following elegant combination, involving back-to-back queen sacrifices: 58...d5 59.e5 Ra4+ 60.Kc3 fxe5 61.f6 Kd6 62.f7 Ke7 63.f8=Q+ Kxf8 64.a8=Q+ Rxa8 65.Rh8+ — but he prefers to lose more prosaically.
59.Ke3 Ra3+
60.Kf4 Ra1
61.Rf7 Kc5
62.Rxf6 Rxa7
63.Re6 Ra1
64.f6 Kc6
65.Kf5 Kd7
66.Re7+ Kd8
67.Ke6

(Sicilian Defense)
1.e4 c5
2.Nf3 Nc6
3.d4 cxd4
4.Nxd4 Nf6
5.Nc3 d6
6.Be2 e5
Euwe plays the Boleslavsky Variation against its inventor: a bit of psychology that often brings good results. To his psychological preparations, the former World Champion has also added a theoretical improvement at the 14th move.
Boleslavsky plays the game peaceably, even somewhat weakly, and Euwe succeeds in equalizing completely.
7.Nb3 Be7
8.0-0 0-0
9.Be3 Be6
10.Bf3 Na5
11.Nxa5 Qxa5
12.Qd2 Rfc8
13.Rfd1 Qb4
14.Rab1 h6
The players are traveling a well-rutted road: the whole line was played repeatedly at the Stockholm tournament in 1952. There, Black played 14...a6; but after 15.a3 Qc4, White was able to pin Black’s knight with 16.Bg5. This move of Black’s forestalls that bishop sortie and preserves the knight’s freedom of movement. For example, he can play ...Nh7, intending ...Bg5, or ...Nd7 followed by ...Nc5. In the Stockholm games, Black had to spend a tempo defending the bishop by ...Qc7 in order to relieve the pin, and then the knight had to go to e8.
15.a3 Qc4
16.Rbc1 a6
17.Be2 Qc7
18.f3 Nd7
Here’s a surprise: one would think that Black would have to keep two pieces watching the d5 square, so that if White ever occupies it, he would have to recapture with his pawn in the event of an exchange, shutting off his pressure on the d6-pawn. But now Black seems willing to give up his “good” bishop for White’s knight, and it appears that White can now occupy d5 with a piece. Euwe, however, by advancing his queenside pawns and posting his own knight on c5, thwarts White’s efforts to install his bishop at d5.
19.Bf1 b5
20.a4 ...
Boleslavsky opens the fight for d5. By attacking Black’s pawns, he forces Black either to capture at a4 or to push to b4; in either event, he can bring his bishop to c4.
20...b4
21.Nd5 Bxd5
22.Qxd5 Nc5
23.b3 Bg5
Black now executes the idea he planned on the previous move of trading off White’s good bishop, ignoring the fact that his d6-pawn appears to be undefended.
24.Bxg5 hxg5
Indirect defense is an often-used technique: it can figure as one of the elements of a combination, or as one of the links in a war of maneuver. In the diagrammed position, the d6-pawn is defended indirectly, since if 25.Qxd6 Qxd6 26.Rxd6, Black can snap off the b3-pawn, formerly defended by both the queen and the c-pawn, with his knight. After 26...Nxb3 27.Rb1 Nd4 28.Rxb4 Nxc2 29.Rb7 Ne3 or 28.Bxa6 Rxc2 29.Rxb4 Ne2+, White could hardly expect to win the ending. Still, this was his best shot, as Black would not have had an easy defense.
25.Kh1 a5
26.h3 Rab8
27.Bb5 Rd8
28.c3 ...
Creating a passed pawn is a logical plan, but it will be a difficult pawn to advance: White’s bishop, which would normally support it, has no support points itself.

33.Qc4 Qa7
34.Rc2 Ne6
35.Qc3 Nd4
Euwe has carried out one of the fundamental ideas of the Boleslavsky Variation by occupying d4 with his knight. The pawns at a4 and d6 are approximately equivalent, but Black’s pieces are now better placed, and soon it will be White who will have to fight for the draw.
36.Rb2 Rdc8
37.Qd2 Kf6!
38.Rc1 Rxc1+
39.Qxc1 Qc5
40.Qd2 Rc8
41.Kh2 Qa3
The sealed move; after analysis, a
DRAW
was agreed to without further play. Black stands more actively, but in Euwe’s opinion, the a-pawn gives White sufficient counterchances.
100. Kotov—Szabo
(King’s Indian)
Castling on opposite wings generally presages pawn assaults against the opposing kings. An exception to this rule consists of the unusual positions arising out of the Samisch King’s Indian. Here both sides, after castling on opposite wings, sometimes push the pawns in front of their own kings. The present game is an example of such play. With the center closed and pawn chains fixed, Black castles short and sets up a break on g4 by playing ...f7-f5-f4, ...g6-g5, ...h7-h5, and ...g5-g4; in the meantime, White opened the b-file leading to his own king for his opponent. This sort of original play on both sides led to offensive breakthroughs on opposite wings, flanking piece maneuvers, and sharp cut-and-thrust play.
The unusual strategic idea, the resourceful and daring play on both sides, and the beautiful concluding combinations make this game altogether an exceptionally interesting one.

4.e4 d6
5.f3 0-0
6.Be3 e5
7.d5 Nh5
8.Qd2 f5
9.0-0-0 Nd7
A substantial improvement on the Geller - Gligoric game, in which Black closed the position with 9...f4. Szabo maintains the central tension and the possibility of posting his knight at f4.
10.Bd3 Nc5
And right now was the proper moment to put this plan into execution: 10...Nf4!, and if the bishop goes to c2 (11.Bc2). then 11...Nb6 (instead of ...Nc5) assails the weakened c-pawn and induces 12.b3.
11.Bc2 f4
Szabo turns down that same rocky road as did Gligoric in the game just mentioned with Geller, thus consigning himself to a protracted and difficult defense, too. In the meantime, Kotov has a clear plan, which Makogonov used successfully again and again in such positions: the king goes to b1, and the knight on g1 goes to d3, either squeezing Black’s knight out of c5 or else inducing the weakening ...b7-b6; meanwhile, his rooks occupy the c- and d-files. Gradually, White prepares the break c4-c5, during which his king will have two pawns’ protection; while Black, in order to set his kingside counterbreak in motion, must strip his king absolutely bare of pawn cover.
In this game, matters do not move along quite as smoothly as we have just described it, but that’s the general scheme; soon the scales begin to tip in White’s favor. Thus, Black should not have closed the game here, either: 11...Nf6 was better, maintaining pressure on e4 and preventing 12.Nge2 tactically, because of the continuation 12...fxe4 13.fxe4 Ng4 or 13.Bxc5 exf3.
12.Bf2 a6
13.Nge2 a5
Szabo is on the horns of a dilemma. Seeing that his intended 13...b5 will not work, in view of 14.b4 and 15.c5, he decides to secure the knight’s position, at least. He conducts the next phase of the game somewhat hesitantly, as though trying to decide what plan he ought to adopt in the face of White’s growing initiative. After the 20th move, however, he decides on a pawn assault leading away from his own king, and plays
va banque
.
14.Kb1 Bd7
15.Nc1 Rf7
16.Nd3 b6
17.Rc1 Bf6
18.Rhf1 Bh4
Obsessed by his desire to exchange off the darksquare bishops, Szabo overlooks White’s simple reply. 18...a4 was necessary, in order to prevent the trade of lightsquare bishops, at least, and to deprive White’s pieces of the square b3.
19.Bxc5 ...
In removing his bishop from f6, Black left the e5-pawn unprotected, so that now he must recapture the bishop with his b-pawn. Strange as it may seem, the line thus opened will turn into an artery of communications for White’s pieces, and not for Black’s. The strategy and tactics of chess still hold many a paradox.
19...bxc5
20.Ba4 ...
A maneuver with the same idea as Black’s ...Bg7-f6-h4, but this one is more successful. Black cannot sidestep the exchange of his “good” bishop, since retreating it to c8 (20...Bc8) would put him in a squeeze. After 21.Bc6 Ra6 22.Nb5, it would be Black’s turn to seek this exchange.
20...Bxa4
21.Nxa4 Qd7
22.Nc3 g5
Black is now in real danger of losing: the threat is 23.Nb5, 24.Rc3, and 25.Ra3, and there seems to be no way to defend the a-pawn, especially since White can also bring up a second knight to b3. In this position, with its fixed pawn chain, White’s knights have great power. Szabo decides to utilize his mobile units where they stand, i.e. on the king’s wing; as a result, the game immediately changes character. The preceding unhurried maneuvering gives way to bitter hand-to-hand fighting, requiring a cool head, resourcefulness and accuracy.
23.h3 Nf6
Necessary, in order to play ...g5-g4. 23...Ng3 would not have served the purpose, in view of 24.Rfd1 h5 25.Nf2!, when both black pieces would be nailed down.
24.Nb5 h5
25.Rh1 ...
Finding the right plan is nowhere near as difficult as carrying it out by means of accurate — and sometimes “only” — moves, while simultaneously counteracting the enemy plan too. Here and later, Kotov’s play is beyond praise. He leaves one rook to withstand the assault, and continuously combines attack with defense.
25...Rh7
26.Rc3 g4
27.hxg4 hxg4
28.Ra3 Bg3
29.Rxh7 Qxh7
Black defends the a-pawn indirectly, intending to undermine g2, the keystone of the sturdy bridge of white pawns.
30.Nc1 Qh1!
By completing the long flanking maneuver ...Qd7-h7-h1, the black queen becomes the first to invade the enemy camp, leaving to its fate not only the c-pawn and the rook, but its king as well. However, Black had no other recourse, since otherwise his a-pawn would have fallen without compensation. Still, White’s last move underscored his obvious advantage, which consists of: 1) the better-protected king, 2) his knight, which is a much more dangerous weapon in an attack on the opposing king than Black’s bishop; and 3) the pawn White wins in the course of his attack, as well as the tempo he wins by his attack on the rook. All this gives sufficient basis for many combinations; it is the master’s skill to select from among those combinations the best and decisive ones.
31.Nxc7 gxf3
32.gxf3 Ra7
33.Ne6 ...
The knight’s position is so threatening here that the black king risks death at the first hostile queen check.
33...Be1
34.Qd1 Rh7
35.Rd3 ...
Warding off Black’s threat of 35...Rh2 and 36...Bd2.
35...Rh2
36.a3 ...
36.Qb3 would not have been so clear, in view of 36...Qg2, when the check at b8 leads to nothing, since g7 is covered by the queen.
36...Nd7
37.Qa4 Qg2
38.Rb3 ...
Kotov defends against the threat of mate at b2, and now threatens simply to take off the knight.
38...Bc3
Szabo is setting a trap. Obviously, the bishop cannot be taken, either by rook or pawn. If White takes the knight, we get the well-known “windmill”: 39.Qxd7? Qxb2+! 40.Rxb2 Rxb2+ 41.Ka1, and now Black can give discovered check by moving his rook to any of a dozen squares. Generally that would be enough to give him at least a draw; here, after 41...Rb7+ 42.Ka2 Rxd7, it would even win.
39.Ne2
A beautiful concluding move to an outstandingly played game. White attacks the bishop and closes the second rank. If the queen takes this knight, then g7 is left unprotected, and White has a mating finish by sacrificing his rook as well: 39...Qxe2 40.Rb8+! Nxb8 41.Qe8+, with mate in three.
BLACK RESIGNED

2.Nf3 Nc6
3.d4 cxd4
4.Nxd4 Nf6
5.Nc3 d6
6.Bc4 Bd7
7.Bg5 Qa5
The last two moves for both sides contain a fair number of opening subtleties. Playing the Rauzer line against the Sicilian, with its 6.Bg5, 7.Qd2 and 8.0-0-0, White generally does not get to bring out his light-square bishop in the early stages; in the Scheveningen, White develops both bishops, but to humbler posts: e2 and e3. In this game, Geller decides to develop both his bishops actively, and apparently he wishes to castle queenside too. If he could manage all this, he would stand beautifully. He began his plan with 6.Bc4, preventing, among other things, the Dragon Variation, in view of 6...g6 7.Nxc6 bxc6 8.e5!, when capturing is obviously impossible because of 9.Bxf7+, winning the queen. 8...Ng4 would be necessary instead, when the pawn advances further still: 9.e6 f5 10.0-0, with an active game for White, following the ancient game Schlechter - Lasker (Match 1910).
Averbakh’s 6...Bd7 prepares to enter the Dragon Variation. White could simply have castled here (7.0-0), the likely continuation being 7...g6 8.h3 Bg7 9.Be3 0-0 10.Bb3, with a good game. But he persists with his idea and plays 7.Bg5.
Averbakh meets this with a daring and original counterplan: forcing White to take his king’s knight (there being no other way to defend both the bishop on g5 and the pawn on e4), and leaving his king where it stands, he initiates a fierce kingside attack right out of the opening. Generally, such strategy runs counter to chess principles; but in this case the open g-file gives Black two developed major pieces, and a powerful pawn center as well. It was just this curious concatenation of circumstances that gave rise to such an unusual plan.
Geller regards Black’s attack as of no consequence, and deliberately castles kingside, pushing his kingside pawns as if to invite his opponent’s attack. Of course, that attack poses no mortal threat to White’s king, but some preventive measures were still in order. Among other things, 9.Bd5 would have been a great deal better than his 9.Nb3: first the queen must be cut off from the kingside, and then 10.Nb3 will be a threat.
8.Bxf6 gxf6
9.Nb3 Qg5!

Along with the witty and subtle finesses aimed at provoking weakenings of the king’s pawn cover, one should not forget such things as one-move mate threats.
11.g3 h5
12.Nd5 Rc8
Black gives up all thought of castling, but such fortitude was not dictated by necessity. Of course the black king is perfectly safe behind its barbed-wire fence of d6-e7-f7-f6, with all its pieces close by; but under these circumstances, the center pawns are not being exploited to the fullest possible extent. The black king’s bishop also will not be able to participate in the game for a long time, and the struggle cannot be won without it.
After 12...0-0-0, intending to continue with ...e7-e6 and ...d6-d5, Black could have opened the center very favorably and obtained definite winning chances.

19.exf5 Bxf5
20.c3 Be6
21.Bg2 ...
A serious inaccuracy. White’s knight is stronger than Black’s bishop here, so he ought not to have allowed its exchange, retreating it instead to e3. Averbakh could hardly have put together any decisive threats with all those white pieces coming after his own king.
21...Bxd5
22.Bxd5 e6
23.Nd4 ...
White’s little tactical threat — 24.Bxc6+, followed by Nf5 and Nxd6+— is easily repelled: 23.Qg2 was better.
23...Be7
The bishop takes its first step, and White’s position immediately looks suspect (23...Kd7 wasn’t bad either).
24.Bg2 Rxg3
Attempting to win the exchange would have been a grievous error: 24...Bh4? 25.Nf5!
25.hxg3 Nxd4
26.Qxd4 ...
If White had taken with the pawn, he would have had a hard time defending both weaknesses, d4 and g3, especially without his darksquare bishop.
26...d5
27.b4 ...
White’s position was difficult, but this move makes it hopeless. He might have put up some resistance with 27.Kf1 Bc5 28.Qd3 Qh2 29.Qf3, maintaining drawing chances, especially if the rooks are exchanged.
27...Rc4
28.Qe5 Qf6
What for? Why not continue the attack on the king with queen, rook and bishop? 28...Bd8 29.Bxd5 Bc7 30.Qg5 Qxg5 31.fxg5 Rxc3 or 30.Qe2 Rxc3 31.Qg2 Qg6 32.Kh2 Rc2 33.Re2 Qh5+ would have led to a clear win. Now Black’s advantage is purely academic.

In that game, White kept a significant positional advantage, although Petrosian put together a fine defense that achieved a draw. Here, in place of his earlier 18...Rfe8, Petrosian plays a more active move. The price of that activity, however, is a strong white center pawn with the bishop-pair — and in my opinion, that’s too high.
19.exd5 Qxd5
20.a4 Rfe8
Black undertakes a series of exchanges, expecting to be left with more pieces available to fight for d5 than his opponent. The battle, however, rages not only for that square, but for the entire board; and the force left to White — a queen and two bishops — is a tremendous one indeed.
21.Qg5 Qf7
22.Ba3 h6
23.Qg3 Rxe1
24.Rxe1 Re8
25.Rxe8+ Qxe8
26.Kf2 ...
Black’s strategy has suffered a fiasco. White has the better game, beyond the shadow of a doubt: his a4-, d4- and c3-pawns are better than Black’s a7-, b6- and c4-pawns. White has his passed pawn already, whereas Black’s pawn on a7 can only become passed over the dead body of the bishop at a3. The transfer of the knight to b3 is played in the faint hope of distracting white’s attention from the events in the center, and inducing the exchange of at least one white bishop, but on b3 the knight is too far from the center of events. Not surprisingly, it cannot quite get back in time to prevent the d-pawn from queening.
26...Na5
27.Qf4 Nb3
Black is apparently willing to risk 28.d5 Qxa4 29.d6 Qxa3 30.d7 Qf8 31.Qc7, since he has the save 29...Qc6; in this line, however, the simple capture 30.Bxf5 would have been quite as strong as it is in the game continuation.
28.Bxf5 Bf5
29.Qxf5 Qxa4
White’s d-pawn becomes more powerful with every exchange and while it advances, the white queen and bishop will also be carrying out an attack on Black’s king. The following moves, up to and including the 40th, were played by Smyslov with the intention of adjourning the game without altering the position, and then finding the surest road to victory. Play really resumes on the 41st move, and it will take a chess miracle to save Black’s game then.
30.Qf8+ Kh7
31.Qf5+ Kg8
32.Qe6+ Kh7
33.Qe4+ Kg8
34.Qa8+ Kh7
Smyslov checks from a different square each time, so as not to repeat the position three times by accident.

36.Qd5+ Kh7
37.Be7 Nc1
38.Qf5+ Kg8
39.Qf8+ Kh7
40.Qf5+ Kg8
41.d5 ...
Smyslov plays a move that he will have to make anyway before adjournment, so as to make his opponent do the thinking before sealing, and also to make it harder for him to analyze the adjourned position.
41...Qa2+
Chess miracles, as opposed to the other sort, still happen on occasion, thanks to chessplayers’ fantasy and the game’s endless possibilities. In this — to all appearances, absolutely lost — position, Petrosian composes a study: Black to move and draw, and demonstrates the solution to Smyslov after adjournment.
42.Kg3 Qd2
43.d6 ...
If 43.Qe6+, to prevent the check on e1, then 43...Kh8 44.d6 Ne2+ 45.Kg4 Qf4+ 46.Kh5 Qxh2+ is perpetual check — and on 46.Kh3, it is mate to
White’s
king.
43...Qe1+
44.Kg4 Nd3
45.Qd5+ ...
If White pushes his pawn to d7 at once (45.d7), then the draw is attained with the problem-like 45...h5+! 46.Kxh5 Qxe7 47.Qd5+ Kh7 48.d8=Q Nf4+; if instead 48.Qe4+, then 48...Qxe4 49.fxe4 Nf4+, and Black even wins.
45...Kh7
46.d7 Qe5!
A move of rare beauty. If White queens, he is mated in two moves; if he trades queens, he loses the d-pawn; and if he retreats by 47.Qd4 Qxh2 forces perpetual check.
Convinced that a genuine miracle had come to pass, Smyslov resigned himself to the loss of a half-point, and forced the draw with a sham queen sacrifice.
47.Qxd3+ cxd3
48.d8=Q
DRAW
In turn, Black’s attempt to play for the win would be easily rebuffed: 48...Qe2 49.Kh3 d2 50.Qd7 d1=Q 51.Qf5+.
However, as it turns out, miracles are sometimes no more than optical illusions in chess as well: 47.Qd6 would have allowed White to defend the h-pawn, skewer-fashion,
through
Black’s queen. On 47...Nf2+ there follows 48.Kh4 g5+ 49.Kh5; and on any other Black reply to 47.Qd6 White simply makes another queen, and his king easily escapes the checks.
Curiously, neither of the players, nor the tournament participants, nor the spectators, noticed this possibility for White. 47.Qd6 was discovered by a Swedish amateur some months after the end of the tournament.
103. Keres—Najdorf
(Sicilian Defense)
1.e4 c5
2.Ne2 Nf6
3.Nbc3 d6
4.g3 Nc6
5.Bg2 g6
6.d3 Bg7
A quiet line of the Sicilian. The play, as you can see, leads to a nearly symmetrical position, the only difference being that the black pawns face the queen’s wing, while White’s face the center. This factor predetermines further planning on both sides. Keres does not employ this unhurried maneuvering system very often, and he later commits a number of inaccuracies, allowing Black, first to equalize, and then to get the better of it.
7.Be3 0-0
8.h3 ...
Smyslov, who best knows the Closed System and plays it like a virtuoso, prefers 8.Qc1 here, intending to trade off the dark-square bishops; if Black forestalls this by 8...Re8 9.Bh6 Bh8, only then 10.h3. The queen’s move to c1, instead of d2, is made with the idea of answering 8...Ng4 by 9.Bd2.
8...Ne8
Black clearly intends to put a knight on d4. Now was White’s last opportunity for 9.d4; failing to play it, he cedes his opponent a spatial advantage.
9.Qd2 Nd4
10.Nd1 Rb8
Black is already prepared to advance the b-pawn, while White hasn’t even castled yet. His next maneuver has as its aim the removal of the knight from d4 and the advance of his pawn to that square, but this plan is doomed to fail. The best plan now was simply to take the knight (11.Nxd4 cxd4) and play 12.Bh6, so that Black’s pawn advance would at least be deprived of the support of his king’s bishop.
11.Nf4 Nc7
12.c3 e5!
A fine example of the use of a tactical stroke to overturn an opposing strategic plan. If Black’s knight were to retreat, then after 13.d4 White would stand well. Now, however, it is White’s knight which must retreat, and d3-d4 will never occur. More: Black immediately plays ...d6-d5 and ...f7-f5, taking over the center completely.
13.Ne2 ...
13.cxd4 would not have suited White any better, since Black would then occupy important central points.
13...Nxe2
14.Qxe2 b6
White has lost the first skirmish: his pieces are poorly posted, with the knight in particular having not a single move.
15.0-0 d5
16.c4 dxe4
17.dxe4 ...
17...f5
Najdorf gives his opponent no rest! The pawn must be taken, as 18...f4 is threatened, and if its path is blocked by 18.f4, then 18...Ne6, and the knight enters the fray with tremendous effect. After the exchange of pawns at f5, Black is suddenly threatening 19...Bd3; and so the white knight, for the sake of whose freedom White played 16.c4, never gets to c3 at all.
18.exf5 Bxf5
19.Re1 Bd3
20.Bg5 Qd4
The triumph of centralization.
21.Qe3 Bxc4
22.Rc1 ...
White’s game is lost: he has no advantages whatsoever to compensate him for the pawn. The continuation 22.Nc3 Ne6 23.Rad1 Qxe3 24.Bxe3 Nd4 would hold out no prospects for him, so he seeks somehow to change the normal course of events. He offers Black the option of winning another pawn, with 22...Bxa2, or sacrificing the exchange himself. Both the one and the other would favor Black:
1) 22...Bxa2 23.b3 Ne6 24.Qxd4 Nxd4 25.Bd5+ Kh8 26.Re3 e4!, with an easy win;
2) 22...Bf7 23.Qxd4 exd4! 24.Bf4 Rbc8 25.Bb7 Nd5! 26.Bxc8 Nxf4 27.gxf4 Rxc8, with a winning position; or if White plays 26.Bd6 (instead of 26.Bxc8), then 26...Nb4, or (26...Nxf4) 27.Ba6 (instead of 27.gxf4) 27...d3 is not bad.
Najdorf disdains both acquiring and sacrificing material, expecting the win to be a matter of simple technique after the trade of queens. However, this exchange substantially improves White’s position, chiefly by bringing his knight back into the game; later, Black also allows White’s rook to reach the seventh.
22...Qxe3

29.hxg4 Nf3+
30.Bxf3 Rxf3
31.Rd1 ...
Black has simplified the game and held onto his pawn, but the quality of his position has been so debased that the win is already in doubt.
31...Rf7
There was something to be said for 31...Bf8, too — mainly that after 32.Ra7 Rf7 33.Rxf7 Kxf7 34.Rd7+, he could bring his king to the center. Of course, Black could expect to lose a pawn in the line 32.Rxe5 Bg7 33.Re2 Rb3, but he would still be left with all of the chances.
32.Rxf7 Kxf7
33.Rd7+ Kg8
34.b3 b5
Black induced 34.b3 by his threat of 34...c4 and 35...e4; now he is able to set about creating his passed pawn by making use of the following standard technique: 35...c4 36.bxc4, and now he does not recapture White’s pawn, but instead pushes his own pawn on to queen with 36...b4. Why must Black continue this way? Because by recapturing at c4, he allows White’s rook, by going to c7, to force him to defend his pawn from the side, after which the pawn could no longer take even one step further; White could then move his king up and take it.
After the inevitable ...c5-c4 and ...b5-b4, White will be in a real spot. Within three moves, Black’s pawn will reach the first rank, so its march must be halted, and not later than b2. In these circumstances, the proper plan would be: 35.Kf1 c4 36.bxc4 b4 37.Bc1 b3 38.Rd2 (perhaps also 38.c5 b2 39.Bxb2 and 40.c6) and 39.Bb2, when the pawn is stopped; or 37...Rc8 38.Rb7 Rxc4 39.Bd2 Bf8 40.g5, when Black could hardly hope to win.
With 35.Rc7, White places his rook in front of his pawn, and also deprives himself of the opportunity of playing Rd2. Now the above variations are no longer operative, and White must give up a piece for the pawn.
35.Rc7 c4
36.bxc4 b4
37.Bc1 e4
38.c5 b3
39.c6 b2
40.Bxb2 Rxb2
The fortieth move! By recapturing with his bishop, Black would have entered a difficult, but still most probably won, endgame: 40...Bxb2 41.Rd7 Rc8 42.c7 Bf6 43.Kf1 Kf8, followed by ...Be7 and ...Ke8; if 44.Rxh7, then 44...Bg7.
41.Rd7
DRAW
Despite his extra piece, Black cannot win. After 41...Rc2 42.c7, Black’s only reasonable move is 42...Bf8. Now the bishop cannot move anywhere, because of the check on d8, the king cannot cross the seventh rank, and the rook can only move up and down the c-file. Remember this position!
104. Reshevsky—Taimanov
(Nimzoindian Defense)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6
3.Nc3 Bb4
4.e3 0-0
5.Ne2 d5
6.a3 ...
White seeks to extract the maximum from this opening by obtaining the advantage of the two bishops without the doubled c-pawns that usually accompany them.
6...Be7
7.cxd5 exd5
8.Ng3 ...
Reshevsky likes this opening position, even though theory does not, considering that Black equalizes with 8...c5. Reshevsky obviously has his own opinions on that score, since he has always been willing to enter the Ng1-e2-g3 line, and plays it outstandingly well.
His opponents in this tournament — Taimanov, and Averbakh in Round 18 — declined to play 8...c5 in favor of their own more intricate, which is not to say better, systems. I still think that 8...c5 is the simplest solution.
8...Re8
9.b4 c6
10.Bd3 b5
No very high level of chess erudition is required to brand this move anti-positional, and to give it a fat question mark, as almost every commentator has done. Its bad points are quite obvious. But the move was played by an international grandmaster, and he undoubtedly saw some good in the move, this being that Black fixes the pawn at b4, and prepares to break with ...a7-a5, aiming to isolate one of the queenside pawns. As for the weakness of the pawn at c6, Black expects to close the c-file with the maneuver ...Nb8-d7-b6-c4, simultaneously bringing this knight to a strong position also.
Perhaps Taimanov would not have been quite so roundly condemned, had it been recalled that the thoughtless 10...b5 was played by Reshevsky himself against Gligoric in a game from their match in New York 1951.
11.Bd2 ...
Gligoric also played in this fashion against Reshevsky. The modest bishop move is exceptionally strong, and destroys both of Black’s hopes. The push 11...a5 would now be risky, on account of 12.bxa5 Rxa5 13.a4! b4 14.Na2 Na6 15.Bxa6; so Taimanov tries bringing his knight to c4 first.
11...Nbd7
12.a4
White would also have met 11...a6 with 12.a4, and even though 12...Bb7 would allow Black to maintain b5, 13.Qb3 Nbd7 14.a5 would have prevented him from getting his knight to c4.
12...Bxb4
13.axb5 c5
14.0-0 c4
White has the freer game. In the present instance, this means that the b5-pawn is a strong damper on the opposing position, the black d-pawn needs piece protection, and Black must also be on his guard against a possible knight incursion on f5. Exchanging on d4 would not change the basics of the position, but merely open another line for the bishop at d2. Taimanov takes an optimistic approach to the position by creating a protected passed pawn, but this gives White some other trumps. Above all, by removing the central tension, he frees his opponent from worrying about his pawn chain, and allows him to concentrate on active minor piece play. As for the passed pawn, its protector is itself in need of protection, and will cause Black no end of worry.
I would have preferred the waiting move 14...Nb6.
15.Bc2 a5
16.bxa6 Rxa6
17.Rxa6 Bxa6
18.Qa1 ...
Beginning a powerful strategic maneuver aiming at the occupation of the a- and b-files by his heavy pieces; especially pretty is the concluding 21.Rb2, which refutes Black’s defensive play.
18...Nb8
19.Qa4 Bf8
20.Rb1 Re6
21.Rb2 ...
Black intended to wrest the b-file away with 21...Rb6, but now this move would achieve nothing, since 22.Qa5 would follow, when the rook must return to d6 (22...Rd6) (22...Nbd7 23.Na4 Rb8 24.Qxa6), and White then definitely takes over the b-file with 23.Na4. Such moves, easily passed over, can frequently be more important than a combination, and decide the outcome of a game.
Black’s position has clearly deteriorated. White’s further plan is to step up the pressure on the d5-pawn; Black does not feel he can tolerate the knight on f4, and so he exchanges it.
21...g6
22.Nge2 Bd6
23.Nf4 Bf4
24.exf4 ...
Despite this apparent weakening of his d-pawn, White submits to the exchange, since it leaves him master of the dark squares. Utilizing the weakening ...g7-g6 he had earlier forced upon Black, his kingside pawn majority and the growing power of his pair of bishops, Reshevsky storms the enemy king position with exceptional energy.
Nothing remains for Black but to try to cut down the number of active pieces on the board, and to ward off the direct tactical threats.
24...Nbd7
25.h3 Rb6
26.Qa5 Qb8
Black did not have this possibility earlier, when b8 was occupied by a knight. Apropos of this, it should be noted that Black had no need to return the knight to b8 on move 18: the bishop on a6 was better defended with 18...Qa8.
27.Rxb6 Qxb6
Here White could have won a pawn by 28.Nxd5 Qxa5 29.Nxf6+ Nxf6 30.Bxa5; his position is so strong, however, that he has no need to distract himself by consideration of the endgame after 30...Nd5.
28.Qa3 ...
28...Nf8
29.Be3 Bc8
Black defends himself against 30.f5, but after 30.g4 he will have to start looking after his d-pawn, in view of the threatened 31.g5. Losing time doesn’t really mean very much here, since Black can’t make any effective improvement in the positioning of his pieces. Taimanov defends very resourcefully, as usual: his play shows no sign of despondency. He tries constantly to set his opponent some new problem — not all that complex, perhaps, but at least it takes up time, and there’s very little of that left!
30.g4 Bb7
31.f5 g5
32.Qe7 h6
33.Na4 Qc6
34.Nc5 Bc8
35.Qd8 Kg7
Here the time-pressure scramble reached its zenith: Reshevsky had literally seconds for the last five moves, whereas Taimanov had a full minute!
36.Bd2 ...
By leaving both his bishops on the second rank for a moment Reshevsky allows Taimanov to pull his queen away from the defense of the bishop at c8, and thereby destroys the fruits of all his skillful play. Instead, 36.Ba4 Qa8 37.Kg2 would have placed Black in complete zugzwang.
36...Qb5
37.Qxc8 ...
In time-pressure, Reshevsky sees a mate, so he gives up the bishop at c2 and retains the darksquare one. But Taimanov incontestably refutes this idea, forcing Reshevsky, at adjournment time, to give serious consideration to how he can keep from losing this game.
Objectively, 37.Bc3 was best, keeping the queen from b2. If then 37...Qe8, White could even trade queens, keeping a sizable advantage in spite of Black’s protected passed pawn.
37...Qb2
38.Kg2 Qxc2
39.Bb4 Ne4!
In such positions, counterattack is the best means of defense.
40.Nxe4 Qxe4+
41.Kg3
Reshevsky sealed this strong move. The game was not resumed, the being agreed to without further play, in view of the following main variation: 41...Nh7 42.Bd6 Qxd4 43.Qc7 Nf6 44.Be5 Qd3+ 45.Kg2 Qe4+ — perpetual check.
DRAW
105. Bronstein—Gligoric
(King’s Indian)
If, having castled, you see that your opponent has closed the center and is preparing a direct pawn storm, then it’s a good idea to open a line beforehand in the region where his king is or intends to be. On that principle, Gligoric sets up some interesting queenside play as early as the ninth move, and obtains a strong counter-initiative.
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 g6
3.Nc3 Bg7
4.e4 d6
5.h3 0-0
6.Be3 ...
Another form of the Samisch Attack, with 5.h3 instead of 5.f3. The advantages of this system are: two dark diagonals are not weakened, the diagonal d1-h5 remains open, and the square f3 as well — Black will find it difficult to establish his knight on h5, when it can always be driven away by Be2. There are disadvantages, too, chief among them the fact that e4 has no pawn protection, which Gligoric skillfully exploits later on.
6...e5
7.d5 Nbd7
8.g4 Nc5
9.Qc2 c6
White is all set to castle long and follow this up by storming Black’s king position. Gligoric chooses this moment to remind him that with the c-file opened, the white king won’t be entirely safe, either.
10.Nge2 cxd5
11.cxd5 Qa5
Black attacks the e-pawn indirectly, using the c-file, as may be seen from the variation 12.Rb1 Ncxe4 13.b4 Qc7.
12.Ng3 Bd7
13.Bd2 ...
Now Black has to reckon with b2-b4, since the pawn will have to be taken, and the queen could find itself lost among the white pieces.
13...Rfc8
An exchange of courtesies. Black invites his opponent to carry out his threat of 14.b4, but White declines the invitation, since after 14.b4 Qxb4 15.Nb5, Black is not obliged to continue 15...Qa4 16.Qxa4 Nxa4 17.Nxd6, with a somewhat inferior endgame; instead, he can sacrifice his queen with 15...Qxb5 16.Bxb5 Bxb5, and White’s king would be in a pitiable state.
14.Rb1 Qd8
15.Qd1 ...
Both queens go home, in order to resume their duel, after a short while, on the king’s wing.
15...a5

30.Rcd1 b4
Both sides are now playing to win an approximately level position. White shuffles his pieces while Black pushes his pawns, trying to get through to the b-pawn. He clears the b5 square in order to trade off White’s king’s bishop there and open an entry for the knight to d3. However, Black’s accomplishments are temporary, while their drawbacks will be permanent. The knight, which now retreats to the first rank, will later be aiming for c4.
31.Nb1 Bb5
32.Bxb5 Rxb5
33.Kf3 Rb7
34.Ke2 ...
The king, which fled the center the moment danger loomed, is back. Now the drawbacks of the King’s Indian Defense begin to assert themselves: the dark-square bishop, if it does not have its say in the middlegame, usually finds little to do in the endgame.

White had his move to seal here, and he could not find enough strength to resist playing 41.Bxc5: first, because it gave him a protected passed pawn; and second, because it gave his opponent a weak, blockaded pawn at c5, and made it easier for his own king to get to b5. Nevertheless, this, was not the best move; although it did not let the win slip, it complicated it considerably. The bishop was a good one, and this was not yet the time to trade it. 41.Ngf1 was correct, bringing back this knight which has stood for thirty moves doing nothing, while maintaining all his threats. The difference is that while it is on e3 the bishop keeps Black’s king out of g5, so that White can spend some time quietly improving his position by transferring the knight, let us say, via h2 to g4; after that, Bxc5 dxc5; Kd3 would lead to an easy win.

The black king’s attempt at counterattack has failed: 48...Kg5 would be met by 49.f3.
49.Kd3 Kd8
50.Nd6 Kc7
51.Nf7 a3
Gligoric wearies of passive defense, and makes an attempt to break things up, which unfortunately leads to a quick loss. If Black had simply stood in place, White would have continued with f2-f3, brought his knight to d3, and then broken up Black’s pawn bastions with a2-a3, etc., according to all the rules of endgame theory. Black’s impatient move appreciably hastens the end.

The bishop’s foray to a6 forced White to slow his usual tempo of development in the Queen’s Indian. But Black’s accomplishments are fleeting: one bishop has already returned to its accustomed place, and now the b-pawn’s advance forces the other’s retreat as well.
10.b4 Be7 11.Bb2 Rc8 12.Qb3 Rc7 13.Rac1 Qa8 14.Qd3 h6 15.Rfd1 Rd8 16.e4 d6
White has kept the pawn from going to d5; and if his knight were on c3, he could strengthen his position still further. With the knight on d2, however, I could find no plan that had any future in it, either at the board or at home. Black’s pieces may Indeed be cramped, but they are well coordinated; together with Black’s pawns, they form a very solid structure. On the whole, it seems to me that the best way to meet the Queen’s Indian is not to allow it. White won two, and Black six, of the fifteen Queen’s Indians played in this tournament: an unenviable result. It was also an atypical one: a more typical result would have been for all fifteen to have ended as draws.

Najdorf’s next two moves, introduced in this game, must be rated an important theoretical achievement, since Black obtains a draw practically by force.
8...Re8
Najdorf apparently came upon this move while analyzing the King’s Indians played not very long before this tournament in his long match against the same opponent. In two of those games, Najdorf defended with 8...Ng4, though unsuccessfully. Whether 8...Re8 or 8...Ng4 is the better move, however, is a question that will have to be left open for the time being.
9.d5 ...
This appears to win a tempo, but the knight unexpectedly goes forward, instead of backward.

12.Bxg7 Kxg7

DRAW
Black may have slightly the better of it: in the endgame, his king can reach a good position via the dark squares. Evidently, in reply to 7...Nc6, should the attempts of a few theoreticians to demonstrate an advantage for White after 8.dxe5 prove unsuccessful, we shall have to return to 8.d5.
108. Keres—Petrosian
(King’s Indian)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 g6
3.Nc3 Bg7
4.Nf3 d6
5.Bf4 ...
A peaceful system, especially unpleasant to those players who essay the King’s Indian in search of double-edged combinative play. It differs from Smyslov’s system (see Games 139 and 184) in that here the pawn is on c4 instead of c3.
Theoreticians tell us that ...e7-e5 is difficult to get in against this line, so Black generally plays for ...c7-c5 instead, following up with a gradual advance of his queenside pawns. Petrosian carries out only the first part of this plan, and then both sides spend a lot of time in slow maneuvering, trying to induce weaknesses.
It still seems to me has no reason not to try for ...e7-e5. But even with the plan he uses in this game, his 5...Nbd7 is a poor choice: 5...0-0 would be better, in order to continue, after 6.e3, with 6...c5, followed by ...Nc6!
5...Nbd7

14.Rad1 Qe7

16.Qb3 ...
An interesting psychological motif is becoming apparent here. By making only “natural” and “necessary” moves, Keres is trying to deceive his opponent into thinking that he plans nothing more than the steady improvement of his position. In fact, he has something completely different in mind: Keres wants (it’s hard to believe this) to whip up an attack on the h-file! To that end, he keeps the knight at h2 for a long time, waiting for the moment when its appearance at g4 will force Black to take it off. Meanwhile, for form’s sake, he “presses” on b6, d6, etc.

And here is that small inaccuracy (21...Nb4 was necessary); now comes —
22.Ng4 ...
Now 22...h5 23.Nxf6+ Bxf6 24.Bxc6 Qxc6 25.Rd5 would be bad for Black; that leaves him small choice between 22...Nb4 23.Bg5 and 22...Nxg4. Petrosian chooses the latter line, as it leaves him with a relatively sounder position.

48.Qe6+ Kh8
Boleslavsky pointed out an amusing move here: 48...Rf7 49.Rxh7 Qf6: Black forces the exchange of queens and draws, against all logic! A rare case indeed!
However, after the problem move ...Rf7 White has the no less original reply 49.Be2. This chance should still have been explored, however, since the “more solid” 48...Kh8 leads to the immediate loss of his extra pawn, and he never does manage to trade queens.

6.Bg5 h6

9.a3 Bxc3+
10.Qxc3 0-0
The minority attack is not just an opening idea most frequently-employed in the Exchange Variation (actually the Carlsbad Variation) of the Queen’s Gambit Declined, but a general strategic idea, which under the right circumstances may be employed at any stage of the game, and not just on the queenside. The point of this attack is to give the opponent weaknesses in the sector where he holds a quantitative pawn majority, and then to attack the weak pawns with pieces.
Here the circumstances are exceptionally favorable for a White minority attack on the queen’s wing. Generally Black, in order to equalize, must undertake a piece attack on the king.
11.Rc1 c6
12.e3 Bf5
13.Be2 Nd7
14.0-0 ...
Why is White delaying his b2-b4 (14.b4)? Black would reply 14...Be4, when 15.Nd2 would be impossible, with the g-pawn loose. White does not want to give up his knight for Black’s bishop either, since that bishop is hampered by its own pawns. However, Black’s next move puts a longtime crimp on the white b-pawn’s advance.
14...a5
In order to prevent the minority attack, the pawn separates from its base and becomes a target itself. Sometimes it happens that such a pawn draws a string of black pawns after it, like a needle pulling thread; in the present situation, however, Averbakh isn’t concerned with its defense yet. What he has accomplished is that White must now set about regrouping his pieces toward a new goal (assailing the a-pawn); Black uses this time to be the first to create threats on the kingside.
15.Ne1 Nf6
16.Nd3 Bxd3
The knight has come under the bishop’s guns after all. The attempt to get the knight to c5 by way of b3, avoiding the b1-f5 diagonal, would have failed, since Black would have answered 15.Nd2 with 15...a4.
17.Qxd3 Rfe8
18.Bf3 Ne4
19.Bxe4 Rxe4
20.Qb3 Qd7
21.Rc5 Rg4
This transfer of the rook to g4 illustrates Black’s counter-chances in this type of position. Usually during the minority attack White’s king is left either completely devoid of piece protection or else covered by just one minor piece. It’s not easy, though, to break through to the king by means of a pawn storm, so the most popular method is the direct frontal assault, especially when g2 and h2 provide such excellent targets for the pieces. Should White have to advance his g-or h-pawn, only then should Black bring in his pawns. The success of such an operation depends upon the concrete peculiarities of the position. In the present instance, Smyslov was not in a risk-taking mood: calling off his attempt to win the a-pawn, he decides to force the draw. A moral victory for Black.

2.c4 e6
3.Nc3 Bb4
4.e3 0-0
5.Bd3 d5
6.Nf3 b6
7.0-0 c5
Although the c-pawn does attack the white center, its presence on c5 also has the drawback of cutting off the king’s bishop’s retreat. The more restrained 7...Bb7 seems more appropriate to me.
8.Qe2 Nbd7
9.cxd5 exd5
10.a3 Ba5
11.b4 ...
Black did not want to give up his bishop, but will soon discover that the white knight is worth more. The assault White now begins against c7 and d6 has the self-evident justification of excluding the darksquare bishop from play. In such cases, the opening of lines generally favors the better developed side. The pawn sacrificed in order to achieve this functions as bait.
11...cxb4
12.Nb5 a6
13.Nd6 Nb8
14.Nxc8 Qxc8
15.Bd2 b3
The quality of a position does not always depend on the quantity of pawns. In this case, Black has enough weaknesses to give White a clear advantage. The thematic line here would be 15...bxa3 16.Bxa5 bxa5 17.Rfc1, when White could look forward to a good harvest, not only of the three a-pawns, but of the d-pawn as well. Naturally, Szabo does not like this variation, so he decides on a counter-sacrifice, to “clutter” the b-file a bit.
16.Rab1 Nc6
17.Rxb3 Bxd2
18.Qxd2 b5
19.Rc1 Qd7
20.Rbc3 Rfc8
21.Ne5 ...
Geller gives his opponent no rest. After the forced exchange on e5, Szabo has new problems, one of them being where to put the knight now on f6. The leap to e4 appears compromising, but in fact it is his best practical chance. Should the knight retreat, the pack of e- and f-pawns would charge unstoppably into the black king’s fortress.
21...Nxe5
22.dxe5 Rxc3
23.Qxc3 Ne4
24.Qd4 ...
White decides he can catch the knight, but that was hardly necessary. 24.Qc7 was simple and good, occupying all the key positions. On the other hand, white’s position is so good that it is hard to spoil with just one move.
24...Qb7
25.h4 h6
26.Rc2 Rc8
27.Rxc8+ Qxc8
28.Qxd5 Nc3
29.Qd6 ...
The knight on e4 has gone on, but the pawn on d5 is no more. Naturally, Black cannot afford to wait until the e- and f-pawns start to roll, so he attempts to get in first with a desperate try at creating a passed pawn on the queenside. The game unexpectedly turns combinative; still more unexpectedly, Szabo obtains real saving chances.
29...a5
30.f4 h5
31.f5 Nd1
32.e6 Nxe3
Anyway.
33.Kf2 ...
The intended 33.e7 is refuted by a queen invasion of White’s rear echelons (33...Qc1+ etc.): an excellent idea from Szabo in severe mutual time-pressure.
33...Ng4+
34.Kf3 Qc1
35.exf7+ ...
The queen check on the eighth rank would not have had the desired effect. Feeling that his win is gone, Geller ensures against loss by guaranteeing himself a perpetual check.
35...Kxf7 36.Qd7+ Kf8 37.Qd8+ Kf7 38.Qd7+ Kf8 39.Qd6+ Kf7 40.Qe6+ Kf8 41.Qd6+ Kf7 42.Qe6+ Kf8
43.Bxb5 ...
This was a mistake. The game was adjourned here, with White having not the slightest advantage: Black’s queen and knight stand too near his king. Apparently unwilling to analyze the position, Szabo called the arbiter and told him that the position had been repeated three times, and was therefore drawn. No one had kept score during time-pressure, so it was only with great difficulty that Geller was able to demonstrate to Szabo the error of his ways, and obtain the right to continue the game. However, the move he sealed was so poor as to require him, once the game was resumed, to expend quite as much energy to demonstrate to Szabo that the position was still a draw. In the hurly-burly of tournament play, it’s not difficult to overestimate one’s own chances — or the other fellow’s, for that matter.
43...Qxa3+
Black would have had more winning chances by not taking the a-pawn here, and playing 43...Qc3+ instead. The enticing endgame Szabo is aiming for turns out, contrary to his expectations, to be a draw.
44.Ke4 Qe3+ 45.Kd5 Nf6+ 46.Kc6 Qxe6+ 47.fxe6 Ke7 48.Bc4 Ne4 49.Kb6 a4 50.Ka5 Nd6
The position is a splendid illustration of a bishop’s power over a knight: despite having an outside passed pawn, Black cannot win.

Szabo will not believe that the position cannot be won, and tries advancing his g-pawn later — which White does not even deign to notice.

(Reti Opening)
1.c4 Nf6

In his theoretical works, Euwe advises against playing to retain the pawn, recommending 5...Nbd7 6.Na3 Nb6 7.Nxc4 Nxc4 8.Qa4+ Bd7 9.Qxc4 Bc6 10.b3 Bd6 instead, with approximately equal play. With 5...a6, apparently, he is trying for more.
6.Qc2 b5
7.Ne5 Nd5
8.d3 ...
An experienced fighter’s decision. Rather than spend a lot of effort trying to regain the pawn, Kotov would rather try for active piece play.

10.Rd1 Qc8
11.a4 Nd7
12.axb5 axb5
13.Rxa8 Bxa8
14.Na3 Bxa3
Black doesn’t want to trouble himself over the defense of his b-pawn, so he rather cavalierly parts with his king’s bishop. However, by trading off this bishop, Euwe presents Kotov with too many of the dark squares. 14...Qb8 was more conservative, although even then White would stand very well after 15.Qb3 c6 16.e4 N5b6 17.Bf4.
15.bxa3 0-0
16.Nc5 ...
Of course, it will not be easy to drive the knight out of here, and it is not in Black’s best interests to trade it off. White is still a pawn down, but the powerful position of his pieces outweighs that.
16...N7b6
17.e4 Ne7
18.Bf1 Bc6
19.f3 ...
By allowing Black to exchange the second pair of rooks, White immediately dissipates his advantage. 19.Bb2 was correct, and then 19...Rd8 would be poor, in view of 20.Qc3 f6 21.Rxd8 Qxd8 22.Nxe6. The line 19...Na4 20.Nxa4 bxa4 21.Qc5 Re8 22.Bh3, with the threat of 23.Qe5, would also be in white’s favor.

112. Boleslavsky—Stahlberg
(French Defense)
1.e4 e6
2.d4 d5
3.Nc3 Bb4
Stahlberg is unwilling to play his usual 3...Nf6, apparently fearing to walk into some sort of preparation. But playing 3...Bb4 is like jumping out of the frying pan into the fire, since Boleslavsky plays the Nimzovich Variation quite a lot himself, and is thoroughly conversant with every Black weakness.
Of course, Stahlberg does make a few changes in Black’s normal defensive layout, but he gets into difficulties just the same.
4.e5 c5
5.a3 Bxc3+
6.bxc3 Ne7
7.a4 ...
A flexible move: depending upon Black’s reply, White may continue with 8.Ba3, 8.Qd2, 8.Qg4, or the game line, 8.Nf3.

14.Re1 Na5
15.Bc1 c4
Black has skillfully masked his actual intentions, which has, in turn, prevented White from putting together a concrete plan of attack; but here he mistakenly lets himself be seduced by the opportunity to open the f-file. It brings him no benefit whatever, and after a few defensive moves, White renews his onslaught. Black would have been better advised to keep to his waiting tactics, fitting his actions to those of his opponent.
16.Bf1 Ng6
17.g3 f6
18.exf6 Qxf6
19.Bg2 Rcc8
20.Qe2 Rf7
21.h4 ...
The tocsin sounds. The dark squares are hopelessly weak, and Boleslavsky begins methodically to increase his pressure. The bishop on c1 will return to its appointed attacking diagonal a3-f8, the rooks will gather on the f-file, the knight will enter e5, and the pawns, supported by the bishop at h3, will advance for the decisive break. What can Black find to oppose this? Very little, other than passive defense.

34.g4 Nd6
35.Ne5 Rc7
36.Bg2 ...
Having achieved a won position, White hesitates. 36.g5 immediately, or after the preparatory 36.Bxd6, suggests itself: in either case, the g-file is opened, and thanks to his great advantage in maneuvering space, White would be able to set up a winning attack. Now Black gets time to pull his knight off the f6 square, so that g4-g5, although it is still playable, no longer wins a tempo.
36...Nde4
37.Rf3 Nd7
38.Ng6 ...
The knight could have been harried a bit with 38.Re3, but White appears to be making a habit of forgetting to open files — the f-file, in this case.
38...Ndf6
39.Ne5 Nd7
40.Kg1 Nxe5
41.fxe5 Ng5
Black has managed to fortify himself on the exact spot where a breakthrough seemed inevitable. The position has now closed up, which deprives White’s bishops of the greater part of their effectiveness. white’s best course here would have been to content himself with an immediate draw, but he could not resist the temptation of winning the queen.
42.Rf8+ Rxf8
Naturally, 42...Kh7 43.Rxe8 Qxe8 44.Rf8 would leave White with a powerful attack; now, however, only Black can have any winning chances.
But Stahlberg does not like exhausting adjournments, so after analyzing the position, he offered a
DRAW
which Boleslavsky accepted.

White is also not developing his bishop to its best square. A more active plan would be to bring his rook to d1 first, and then to play 10.h3, preparing to develop the bishop to e3.
9...Bf8
10.Bb2 Nh5
11.g3 g6
12.Rad1 Nhf6
13.d5 ...
The position begins to take on the aspect of a “normal” King’s Indian. Not wishing to allow the opening of the center after 13...exd4, White pushes his pawn, and the war of maneuver continues.

31.Bc2 Bg6
32.Qe2 e4
Soon both sides will begin trading threats — a boon to the reader who, after this rather tedious overture, will now see a delightful combination and a delicate endgame.
The pawn advances in order to secure f3 for the knight which is now on d7. Since the fianchettoed bishop also threatens White’s queen’s knight, it might seem that the maneuver ...Nd7-e5-f3+ could not be prevented. Stahlberg dissipates that illusion by means of a forcing variation.
33.Nf4 Re8
34.Ne6+ Rxe6
35.dxe6 Bxc3
36.exd7 Qxd7
So now White has won the exchange; but that was not the reason his knight invaded e6 with check. If Black had time to get in 37...h5, White’s initiative would wither, so:
37.h5 Bxe1
38.hxg6 Bc3
39.gxh7 Rh8
An innocent-looking move that conceals a dastardly trap. The game is about even here, and after 40.Kg2 and 41.Rh1, the draw would have been quite obvious. But with his last move in time-pressure, Stahlberg trustingly attacks the bishop, no doubt expecting that Black would find nothing better than 40...Bf6.
40.Qe3 Kg6!
The king fulfills three tasks with one move: defending g5, clearing the queen’s path to h7, and avoiding the check — that’s important too! — in the event of 41.Qxc3. What is memorable is not just the idea of the combination, but the cleverness with which it is carried out. Suddenly, unexpectedly, the white king is in trouble.
41.Rd1 Bd4
42.Qf4 Qxh7
43.Kf1 Qh1+
44.Ke2 Qh5+!
Kotov plays this second part of the game with uncommon energy and resourcefulness. White, it would seem, was just waiting for the chance to play g3-g4; yet here is Black, giving him the opportunity to play it with tempo!
45.g4 Qxg4+
46.Qxg4+ fxg4
47.Bxe4+ Kg5
Here’s the rub: despite the bishops of opposite color, White has a lost game. Let’s see why:
1) Black’s bishop is supported, and stands very well at d4, while the same cannot be said of the bishop at e4.
2) Black’s king is far more active than its white counterpart, and in fact assumes a leading role in the fight.
3) Nor are the pawns on f2 and g4 equivalent: where the pawn on f2 is weak and needs protection, the pawn on g4 stands ready to assist its pieces in their assault on the pawn at f2.
All of these advantages would lose their importance if White could just manage to get the rooks traded off, but he can’t. The game’s concluding phase is most instructive.
48.Rh1 Re8
49.f3 b5
50.Kf1 bxc4
51.bxc4 g3

Stahlberg is doing everything he can. Before all else, he denies the black rook entry into his camp. Were it not for the passed g-pawn, that might have been enough to save the game.

Euwe’s passive play has allowed Geller to set up a good attacking position. Sooner or later, the knight on d4 will have to be taken by the bishop, which will give Black still more positional advantages.
22.a5 f4 23.gxf4 Qxf4 24.Rf1 Nf6 25.c5 Ne4
Black’s knights are insufferable, but —
26.Bxe4 Qxe4 27.Bxd4 exd4
— the advantage of the two bishops in this case came down to their being able to get rid of two good knights in two moves.

An important element of Black’s plan. Concluding that simple means will not suffice against white’s position, Black first removes his king to the opposite wing, where it will not be exposed by his upcoming pawn storm. White’s knight follows, and takes up station, so Black’s king will not forget the possibility of a deadly check on the eighth rank.

Euwe loses his patience, and eases Black’s task.

Black has found the white king’s Achilles heel: the g1 square.
54.Qg7 Bf4 55.Kg2 Be3 56.Rf1
White loses without a fight. 56.Rf7 had to be tried, and then Black would have had to find the complex line 56...Qg1+ 57.Kf3 Qf1+ 58.Kg3 Bf4+! 59.Kh4 Qf2+ 60.Kg4 h5+. Now, everything is much simpler.
56...Qd2 57.Rf7 Qxe2+ 58.Kg3 Qe1+ 59.Kf3 Qh1+ 60.Kg3 Qg1+ 61.Kf3 Qf2+ 62.Ke4 Re8+ 63.Re7 Qh4+

11.Bd3 ...
Repeating the opening of Game 34, Boleslavsky - Smyslov, but Szabo finds an improvement, 11.Bd3, over Boleslavsky’s 11.e5, which gave White nothing.
11...Qa5
Not a very good move. In Game 128 against Stahlberg, two rounds later, Smyslov played 11...h6, and quickly achieved full equality, while in his match with Geller Smyslov successfully employed 11...Bh5. Since White cannot achieve anything with this variation, the thought comes to mind that perhaps 10.e4, or even 5.a4, may not be best.
12.Na2 Be7
13.Bd2 Qh5
14.Nc3 Rfd8
15.Bf4 c5
16.d5 ...
The standard break in such positions. First White closes d5 to Black’s knight; then he drives it away with 17.e5, after which he can recapture the d-pawn, obtaining a strong central position for his own knight.
16...exd5
17.e5 Bxd3
18.Qxd3 Ne8
19.Nxd5 Bf8
20.Qb3 Qg6
21.a5 ...
White nails down the b-pawn, but he cannot take it yet, owing to the ensuing “perpetual check” to his queen: ...Ra8-b8-a8. His next move strengthens the threat to the b-pawn.
21...h6
22.Ne3 b6
23.Rfd1 Nc7
24.Bg3 ...
Black must now find a defense to the threatened 25.Bh4. Szabo is playing with great verve, and Black’s position grows critical.
24...b5
25.Bh4 c4
26.Qc3 f6
27.Nxc4 ...
White wins a pawn, but renders his win more difficult. Black would have had a rougher go of it after 27.b3 Nxe5 28.Nxe5 Rxd1+ 29.Rxd1 fxe5 30.bxc4 bxc4 31.Qxc4+ Ne6 32.Ng4 — his best chance would have been 30...b4.

31.Bg3 a6

33.Rdc1 Bb4
DRAW
— at White’s instigation.
Szabo would have retained significant winning chances in the endgame after, let’s say, 34.Rxc8 Rxc8 35.Ra4, when Black would be unable to recover the b-pawn: 35...Rc1+ 36.Ke2 Rc2+ 37.Kd1 Rxb2 38.Kc1 Rb3 39.Kc2 Rc3+ 40.Kb2 Rc4 41.Kb3. He would have had to retreat his bishop: 35...Bf8; then White replies 36.Ne1, slowly improves the position of his pieces, and still retains excellent chances to make something out of his extra pawn.
116. Averbakh—Keres
(Ruy Lopez)
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 0-0 8.c3 d6 9.h3 Na5 10.Bc2 c5 11.d4 Qc7 12.Nbd2 Bb7 13.d5
White closes the center, in order to begin storming the king-side.
13...Bc8 14.Nf1 Bd7 15.b3 g6 16.Bh6 Rfb8 17.g4
White made one attacking move, and stopped there. Averbakh is giving notice that he will continue his aggression only in the event Keres starts pushing his queenside pawns.
17...Bf8 18.Qd2 Kh8 19.Ng5 Kg8 20.Nf3 Kh8 21.Ng5 Kg8 22.Nf3
DRAW
Black is unable to break the repetition, since after Nf3 White threatens Bxf8 and Qh6, followed by Ng5 once again. Therefore, Black moves his king to h8, so as to answer Qh6 by ...Ng8. But of course White is by no means obligated to repeat moves...
117. Petrosian—Reshevsky
(Reti Opening)
1.Nf3 Nf6
2.g3 g6
3.Bg2 Bg7
4.0-0 0-0
5.d3 d5
6.Nbd2 c5
7.e4 ...
This is a King’s Indian with reversed colors; consequently, White has an extra tempo. This is a structure which has been heavily used of late by Soviet masters, and which demands a great deal of alertness from Black. Schemes which White can well employ against the King’s Indian can prove lethal when Black employs them a move behind. Reshevsky chooses an exchange of center pawns, which is approximately equivalent to the line in which White plays d4xe5. This generally leads to complete leveling, but here White manages to carry out the advance of his e- and f-pawns to the fifth rank.
7...dxe4
8.dxe4 Nc6
9.c3 h6
10.Qe2 Be6
11.Ne1 Qb6
12.h3 Rad8
13.Kh2 Nh7
14.f4 ...
White already stands somewhat superior, thanks to his advantage in terrain. His next task is to regroup his pieces, presently posted on the first two ranks, in order to support the further advance of his e- and f-pawns. One very important factor in this is that his opponent has no active plan; indeed, Black’s pieces spend the next seven moves nearly inactive, unless you consider the transfer of the bishop to the other long diagonal — which of course could have been done earlier, without wasting time on the maneuver ...Bc8-e6-d7-c6.
14...Na5

17.Nf1 b6
18.Ne3 Bc6
19.Ng4 Nf6
20.Nf2 Bb7
21.e5 Nh7
22.h4 ...
White has already won the strategic battle: his opponent’s pieces have been driven back to the last two ranks. The natural plan now for White would be to advance his f- and g-pawns for a breakthrough on the kingside. Petrosian takes a somewhat different course: by threatening h4-h5xg6 etc he induces the blockading h6-h5; then he sacrifices a pawn with f4-f5! If Black accepts White’s knight on f2 goes with great profit, to f4 -an excellent stratagem
22...h5
23.f5 Qd7
Reshevsky declines the sacrifice, of course, but now the e-pawn enters the fray. Black manages to ward off white’s onslaught, but his e- and h-pawns become isolated.
24.e6 Qd5
25.exf7+ Qxf7
26.fxg6 Qxg6
27.Ng5 Bxg2
28.Kxg2 e5
29.Qe4 Rf5
30.Nxh7 Kxh7
DRAW
White’s position is far superior, of course. If queens are exchanged, Black’s weak pawns will be excellent targets; and if they are not exchanged, Black’s exposed king and the continual need to watch over its safety would tie Black hand and foot.

5.Bd3 b6
6.Nf3 Bb7
7.0-0 0-0
8.Bd2 d6
9.Qc2 Nbd7
Here Black refrained from the tempting 9...Bxf3, as he felt he would not be able to exploit the weakening of White’s king protection: e.g., 9...Bxf3 10.gxf3 cxd4 11.exd4 Nc6 12.Be3, when the king is quite secure. Nevertheless, Black should still have played this, but with the idea of attacking, not the king, but the opposing center. After 12...Bxc3 13.Qxc3 d5 or 13...e5, we would have had some interesting play, whereas now White develops a clear advantage, and Black must employ all of his alertness.
10.a3 Bxc3
11.Bxc3 Rc8
12.Nd2 h6
13.Rac1 d5
14.b3 dxc4
15.bxc4 Qc7
Black’s chief worry is how to prevent d4-d5. He must also keep an eye out to prevent White from entrenching his knight at e5, or setting up the battery Bb1 and Qc2; if that does happen, he must have ...Nf8 ready. Black has plenty of worries, as may be seen. But it is a bore to think only about defense: Black’s 14...dxc4 carries with it the hope of exploiting the active position of his fianchettoed bishop, and perhaps the relative weakness of the pawns at c4 and d4. Black would very much like one of those two pawns to advance. White also has the threat of ...Nf6-g4 to deal with here.
16.Rfd1 ...
White is not placing his rooks right: he ought to occupy the e- and d-files.
16...Rfe8
17.Nf1 cxd4
18.exd4 Qf4
19.Ng3 h5
Black must hurry before White plays 20.Re1 and tries to bring one of his rooks to g3, after his knight goes to e4. A rook on g3, in conjunction with the bishop on c3, could demolish g7.
20.h3 h4
21.Nf1 Ne4
DRAW
The knight at e4 must be taken, and after 22.Bxe4 Bxe4, White’s advantage disappears.
119. Taimanov—Gligoric
(Sicilian Defense)
The sacrifice of a pawn for the initiative is one of the most complex problems of chess strategy — and perhaps of its psychology as well. The positions that occur as the result of a sacrifice are so varied that no generalizations can possibly be made. Some grandmasters, possessing the faculty of quick calculation, not infrequently give up a pawn or two simply to alter the nature and balance of a position, even if this is perhaps not in their favor. I don’t think this manner of playing has much of a future. I myself have sacrificed, all told, several dozen pawns, but still I think that the master who sacrifices a pawn ought to have at least a general idea of the nature of the initiative he will thereby obtain, and what sort of game will ensue.
Once in a while, a pawn must be given up, or even an exchange or a piece, against one’s will— the point being that any other course leads to a difficult position. Playing White, Taimanov sacrificed a pawn in the opening, but obtained no more of an initiative thereby than he might have obtained by keeping the same number of pawns as his opponent. Throughout the game, White put himself through agonies trying to regain his pawn, but never quite succeeded; eventually, Black’s extra pawn went on to queen.
1.e4 c5
2.Nf3 d6
3.Bb5+ ...
The exchange of lightsquare bishops on the fourth move is part of a farseeing strategic idea. Gligoric has placed his pawns on dark squares, so Taimanov thinks that with the lightsquare bishop gone Black will find it hard to maintain the positional balance. Of course, Black can advance his center pawns to e6 and d5, but that will take time.
3...Bd7
4.Bxd7+ Qxd7
5.0-0 Nc6
6.Re1 ...
After the exchange of bishops, I think it makes more sense to put the pawn on the light square d3 and the knight on c3 (where it controls the light square d5), and after Black plays ...e7-e6 or ...g7-g6, to prepare the advance f2-f4-f5. Taimanov acts illogically in selecting a plan which helps Black to clear the c5-f8 diagonal, presently cluttered with black pawns.
6...Nf6
7.d4 cxd4
8.Bg5 ...
White decides not to recapture the d-pawn, choosing instead a sharp move he had prepared previously; he expects 8...e5 9.Bxf6 gxf6 10.c3!, or 8...g6 9.Bxf6 exf6 10.Nxd4, or 8...Ng4 9.Nxd4 h6 10.Bc1. However, Gligoric finds an excellent plan which knocks the last white pawn out of the center and secures active positions for Black’s pieces.
8...d5
9.Bxf6 ...
There’s not much choice: Black would answer 9.e5 with 9...Ne4.
9...gxf6
10.exd5 Qxd5
11.Nc3 Qd7
12.Ne4 0-0-0
13.c3 ...
Of course, Taimanov sees that his strategic plans have come a cropper: Black has a pawn more, with the possibility of setting up a powerful center, while the white knights have no points of support. The ability to make exceptionally objective assessments of events as they are occurring is one of Taimanov’s outstanding traits — a trait to be envied, and certainly imitated as well. Here, White’s only hope lies in creating complications, and Taimanov is ready to answer 13...dxc3 with 14.Qb3, giving up his b-pawn into the bargain. However, Gligoric not only declines further acquisitions, he even gives back his extra pawn temporarily, securing his advantage by advancing his pawns to f5 and e5.
13...f5
14.Nc5 Qd5
The interesting complications that arise after 14...Qc7 would work out in Black’s favor, but these would be complications nonetheless, which is precisely what Taimanov is aiming for; so Gligoric sticks with the strong move 14...Qd5, centralizing his queen. On 14...Qc7, White would have replied 15.cxd4 e5 16.Rc1 e4 17.Ne5 Rxd4 18.Qb3, but Black had a better alternative in 17...Nxe5! 18.Ne6 fxe6 19.Rxc7+ Kxc7 20.Qb3 Nc6 21.Qxe6 Nxd4 22.Qe5+ Bd6.
15.cxd4 e5
16.Rc1 exd4
Taimanov’s relentless play for complications has borne fruit: Black plays inexactly here. 16...e4 was correct, when 17.Ne5 would be out because a piece would be lost, and 17.Nh4 would run into 17...Be7 18.Qh5 Bxh4 19.Qxh4 Qxd4 20.Qh5 Qf6. Now Black’s extra pawn has no great role to play, since it is blockaded, and his isolated pawns on the kingside are weak.
17.Nd3 Bd6
18.Nfe5 ...
White seeks his chances precisely where they will be the hardest to find: he can extract nothing from the pinned knight at c6, so he ought to have attacked the f5-pawn with 18.Nh4 and 19.Qh5.
18...Rhe8
19.Nxc6 Rxe1+
20.Nxe1 bxc6
21.Qd3 ...
What has White achieved? The d-pawn is no longer isolated, and the knight which blockaded it has had to be replaced with the queen.
21...Kb7
22.b4 ...
Too bold. Taimanov should have recalled his third move, Bb5+, which deprived his opponent of his lightsquare bishop, and tried to keep the black pawns on dark squares. For this purpose, 22.b3 was best, followed by the transfer of his knight to c4.
22...Bf4
23.Rd1 Bc7
24.a3 Bb6
25.Nf3 Qe4
26.Ng5 Qxd3
27.Rxd3 a5!
This excellent move decides the game. Black returns his extra pawn at the best possible moment.
In a few moves, he picks up the b-pawn, after which his two connected passed pawns will bring him victory.
28.Nxf7 Rd5

30.axb4 Ka6
31.f4 Kb5
32.Ne5 Bc7
33.Rd1 Bd6
33...Bxe5 34.fxe5 Kxb4 would have been a gross blunder, in view of 35.e6!, when the threat to support the advance of this passed pawn with a rook would have forced Black to seek the draw.

3.d4 cxd4
4.Nxd4 Nf6
5.Nc3 a6
6.g3 e5
7.Nde2 Be6
8.Bg2 b5
Najdorf repeats the move Kotov played against Gligoric in Game 66. This time, Gligoric begins immediate operations on the queenside. As one of the spectators pointed out, however, he could have played still more sharply: 9.Nf4, and if Black accepts the sacrifice (9...exf4), 10.e5 simultaneously attacks a8 and f6; while if he does not accept, the knight makes a triumphal entrance at d5.
9.a4 b4
10.Nd5 Nxd5
11.exd5 Bf5
12.0-0 Nd7
13.Bd2 Rb8
14.f4 Bg6
15.h3 f6
16.Kh2 Be7
17.a5 Qc7
18.c3 b3
19.f5 Bf7
A curious moment: in the middlegame, the rook occupies an open line, though not a file, as is usual; this time it’s the fourth rank, completely cleared of both white and black pieces. Najdorf could have prevented this by 16...a5, but of course it never entered his head that his opponent might intend, in the middle game with a board full of pieces, to open the fourth rank and occupy it with a rook.
20.Ra4 ...
As he played this original move, Gligoric offered a draw, which Najdorf declined, although his position gave him no grounds for so optimistic an appraisal, as he himself later concluded. For example, after 20...0-0 21.Nc1 Nc5 22.Rb4! Qxa5 23.Nxb3, White has good play.
20...Nc5
21.Rg4 g6
22.Rb4 ...
Unexpected, and foolhardy: White abandons the f-pawn, hoping to regain the b-pawn. In this game, Gligoric’s normally strict style is unrecognizable.
22...gxf5
23.Be3 0-0
24.Nc1 Bg6
25.Nxb3 Rxb4
26.cxb4 Ne4
27.Qe2 Qb7
28.Nd2
And now it was Najdorf who offered the
DRAW
which was accepted, although White still has the superior position. Black would be ill-advised to take the b-pawn, in view of 28...Qxb4 29.Nxe4 fxe4 30.Bh6 Rb8 31.Rf2, with the threat of h3-h4-h5; also possible is 30.Qxa6 Qxb2 31.Qb6, when the exchange of queens would lose for Black.
Black might have been able to wriggle out of his difficulties by means of the piece sacrifice 28...Nxg3 29.Kxg3 f4+ 30.Bxf4 exf4+ 31.Rxf4 f5; Najdorf carries his analysis to move 51. The variations are interesting, no doubt, but it would have been more interesting still had the game continued.
121. Bronstein—Petrosian
(Old Indian Defense)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 d6
3.Nc3 Nbd7
4.Bg5 h6
5.Bh4 g5
This is the sort of move that radically alters the course of a game, forcing the opponent to rethink all the details of the position. Mechanically, the move ...g7-g5 is simple to explain: Black exchanges off the bishop on g3 for his knight, thereby-enhancing the prospects of his own king’s bishop. However, “pawns do not move backward”, and moving the pawn from g7 to g5 defines the pawn structure in this sector too early, making it easier for White to formulate a concrete plan.
6.Bg3 Nh5
7.e3 Nxg3
8.hxg3 Bg7
9.Bd3 Nf6
10.Qd2 c6
11.0-0-0 Qa5
white’s last three “attacking” moves offered his opponent no problems whatever: he is making his preparations to attack in the wrong sector. The drawbacks of Petrosian’s defense might have stood out if White had played 9.f4, assailing the g-pawn.
12.Kb1 Bd7
13.Nge2 e6
14.Nc1 0-0-0
15.Nb3 Qc7
16.Qe2 Rhe8
17.e4 ...
White has wasted a lot of time in preparing for this advance, which now encounters Black’s excellent defensive formations.
17...c5
18.e5 dxe5
19.dxe5 Ng8
20.f4 ...
Now, ten moves too late, this misses the point completely, and allows Black to open the game in his favor.

21.gxf4 f6
22.Nb5 Bxb5
23.cxb5 Kb8
24.Rc1 b6
25.Bg6 Rf8
26.Rhe1 ...
White sacrifices a pawn in the mistaken hope of being able to entice the black rook to e5; however, White will be unable to exploit either the h1-a8 diagonal or the open d-file, in view of the unfortunate position of his knight on b3. One cannot help but recall Tarrasch’s famous dictum (see Preface)!
26...fxe5
27.fxe5 Rd5
28.Be4 Rxe5
29.Qc2 Rd8
30.Red1 Rxd1
31.Rxd1 Ne7
32.Nd2
DRAW
White’s position would be not a bit inferior, if his knight could only manage to maintain itself on c4. However, with 32...c4!, Black would prevent this: 33.Nxc4 Rxb5 or 33.Qxc4 Qxc4 34.Nxc4 Rxe4. On the other hand, White need not take the pawn: his best course would be to continue 33.a4, retreat his bishop to f3, and keep trying to work up counter-threats against the black king. In time-pressure, Petrosian failed to notice 32...c4, and therefore agreed to the draw.
122. Reshevsky—Averbakh
(Nimzoindian Defense)

3.Nc3 Bb4
4.e3 0-0
5.Ne2 d5
6.a3 Be7
7.cxd5 exd5
8.Ng3 Be6
Since White has not prevented ...c7-c5, Black ought to have exploited this in the interests of freer development: among other things, his knight could have gone to c6 instead of d7. Averbakh opts for a solid but passive deployment, which allows Black too few counterchances for him to have hopes for anything more than a draw. With 8...c5, Black would have knocked the d-pawn out of the center, opened the c-file, and cleared the e5 square for his pieces.
9.Bd3 Nbd7
10.0-0 c6
11.Bd2 Re8
Black feels he has fulfilled his primary goal in the Nimzo-Indian by putting a long-term crimp on e3-e4. White begins unhurried preparations for the e-pawn’s advance, while Black holds to his siege tactics: the value of his sortie ...a7-a5-a4 is more symbolic than real. Against this backdrop, Black’s position declines noticeably over the next ten or twelve moves: the bishop’s dithering from c8 to e6 to d7 to c8 to e6 again does not involve any sort of strategy, serving only to demonstrate the impregnability of Black’s position. Meanwhile, White marshals his forces for the decisive stroke.
12.Qc2 a5
13.Nce2 Nb6
14.Nf4 Bd7
15.Rfe1 Bf8
16.f3 Bc8
Black has so far managed to prevent e3-e4, but Reshevsky will push his plan through.
17.Rac1 g6
18.Nfe2 Bg7
19.h3 a4
20.e4 dxe4
21.fxe4 Be6
22.Be3 Bb3
23.Qd2 ...
White has created a powerful center. The next part of his plan will be an attack on the king, but it is not yet the time for the pieces to enter the fray: first the h-pawn must advance, to breach the fortress walls.
This game is vintage Reshevsky: instead of flinging himself head over heels into the attack, he methodically accumulates advantages, while trying not to give his opponent any counterchances. Averbakh misconstrues the gradual development of white’s attack, taking his caution for indecision. The position already requires Black to take energetic action on the queenside.
23...Nfd7
24.Bg5! f6
An unpleasant weakening of the king’s wing. With the pawn at f7, the routine attack h2-h4-h5 would lose much of its effectiveness, inasmuch as the capture h5xg6 could always be met by recapturing with the f-pawn. 24...Bf6 was bad, of course, since White would take the bishop, bring his rook to the f-file, and then push his pawn to e5. And retreating the queen to c7 would place that piece in a most uncomfortable position.
Averbakh’s only hope is to counterattack the white center (30...c5).
25.Be3 Nf8
26.h4 Bf7
The h-pawn could have been stopped here with 26...h5, so 26.Bh6!, followed by 27.h4, was more accurate.
27.h5 Ne6
The defenders of the fortress place themselves in readiness for battle with the maneuvers ...Ne6, ...Bf8 and ...Nd7, preparing to sell their lives dearly (Black is also preparing ...c5).
28.Rf1 Bf8
29.Rf2 Nd7
30.Rcf1 c5
At last, at last! (Wouldn’t this have been better played at move eight?)
31.d5 Nc7
32.hxg6 hxg6
The e5 square Black has obtained for his pieces doesn’t come anywhere near compensating for White’s control of the h-file. It’s only a question of how soon White can manage to double or triple his heavy pieces there.
33.Rf4 b5
34.Rh4 Ne5
35.Kh1 Qd7?
Black is in an unenviable position, of course, but a grandmaster should not fall apart like this, simultaneously giving up both a pawn and a key point in his position. White might have begun the conquest of h6 and g7 on his 35th move with 35.Bh6! Instead, he played a waiting move, 35.Kh1, for which there was no particular need, since nothing threatened the white king where it stood. Quite evidently Reshevsky had still not completely made up his mind to force through the attack. Since matters were proceeding through one of his accustomed time-shortages, he wanted to play a few nondescript moves to reach the time control. It was precisely these circumstances that made it imperative for Averbakh to play 35...b4, stirring up some complications, at least. One time-pressure possibility might have been 36.Bh6 Nxd3 37.Bxf8 Kxf8 38.Qxd3, when Black holds things together somehow. And if White should delay his Bh6 long enough to play, shall we say, 36.axb4, then 36...a3 would give Black some serious counter-chances. After Averbakh’s blunder, White’s problem finds an easier solution.
36.Rxf6 Ng4
37.Bg5! Bg7
Accepting the exchange sacrifice would lead to a quick checkmate: for example, 37...Nxf6? 38.Bxf6 Bg7 39.Bxg7 Kxg7, and the queen checks from c3 (40.Qc3+), with decisive threats. Play would have proceeded similarly had Black chosen 36...Be7 instead of his 36...Ng4.

This game is a classic example of how one should undermine the foundation of a solid position. Reshevsky considered it his best game of the tournament.

The various lines of this system of development are distinguished chiefly by the placement of the f- and a-pawns, In Game 88, Geller played f2-f4 and a2-a4 against Najdorf, with an active position for White, but somewhat insecure in the center. In Game 36, Smyslov pushed both pawns one square against Kotov. In this game, Keres plays f2-f4, but leaves the a-pawn in place for the time being. I myself prefer a2-a4 and f2-f3.
Thus are the masters’ tastes revealed even in the opening. So let the reader be properly skeptical of such notes as: “Better a2-a4”, or “f2-f3 was more circumspect.” In the beginning of the game, there are many roads, and most of them lead straight to Rome.
10...Rc8
11.Kh1 Bc4
Contrary to the rules of positional play, here Szabo offers the exchange of his good bishop — and rightly so. In the first place, this bishop is living in constant fear of White’s threat to advance the f-pawn, which means it’s not so good after all. And in the second place, Szabo wishes to use the rather shaky condition of White’s e-pawn to fight for the square d5, which would make his other bishop “good”.

16.Bd4 ...
Keres stirs up some interesting complications, but Black still has sufficient counter-chances. White’s best lines arise after 16...Nc6 or 16. for example:
1) 16...Nc6 17.Bxf6 Bxf6 18.exd5 Qxd5 19.Nde4;
2) 16...Ng6 17.e5 Nd7 18.Nf3, or 17.Bxf6 as in the first variation.
As usual, Szabo finds the most active continuation.
16...Nfg4
17.Rf4 ...
This gets White two knights for his rook and two pawns. As for 17.h3, that’s no threat: Black replies 17...Bc5 here, too, and can always meet hxg4 (18.hxg4) with the queen check at h4 (18...Qh4+).

24.Qa4 ...
We shall have occasion to compare the relative strengths of queen, rook and knight again in Game 186, Kotov - Najdorf. Knights and queens complement each other, knights being strong in the center and around enemy pawns; while rooks come into their own in the endgame, where they find plenty of space for their straightforward maneuvers. Proceeding from these ideas, White ought to utilize his knights on the kingside, without trading queens, trying for something such as the following: 24.Qg4 Qf6 25.Rf1 Qg6 26.Ng5 Qc2 27.Qf3, or 24.Qg4 Qc8 25.Nf5 Qc3 26.N3d4.
24...Qc8
25.Nf5 Qc6
26.Qd4 ...
Here too, 26.Qg4 Qf6 (26...Qg6? 27.Ne7+!) 27.Rd1 was good. However, the queen exchange was most tempting: White’s knights gain permanent sway over f5, and it was hard to foresee that fate would send them somewhere else altogether.
26...Qf6
27.Qxf6 gxf6
28.a4 Rb4
29.a5 ...
The knight’s active position on f5 might have been exploited for an attack on f7. For this purpose, the rook at a1 would have to be brought to d7; the loss of the a-pawn would be inconsequential, since the b-pawn would be recovered immediately: 29.Rd1 Rxa4 30.Rd7, with the double threat 31.Nh6+ and 31.Rxb7. White’s actual move, powerful though it might appear, leads, amazingly enough, to a difficult endgame for him.
29...Rf4
30.Nd6 Rb8
31.Rb1 Ra4
32.Rxb7 Rxb7
33.Nxb7 ...
In the middle of the board, supported by a pawn, one knight may sometimes be as strong as a rook. Here, however, on the edge of the board, the knights cannot work at full strength, and one rook can deal successfully with two knights. Black’s plan — to bring up his king, drive off the knight, or else force the trade of both knights for his rook — looks very dangerous indeed. Keres’ following maneuvers, creating unbreachable defensive positions with two knights and a pawn, without the aid of the king, are beautiful beyond comparison.
33...Kf8
34.Nd2 Ke7
35.Nb3 Rb4

A wonderful position!
The knights fend off their foes. Now Black pushes his pawn to f5, and opens a route for his king to go via f6 and e5 to d4.

Otherwise, the knight forks when his king gets to e5.
38.Kf2 Kf6

40.Nb6 ...
The knights have regrouped, and are once again unapproachable. Now the black rook attempts to penetrate from the flank.
40...Ke5
41.Kg3 Rb3+
Here Black had an interesting try: 41...f4+, intending after 42.Kh4 to play for the win of a pawn by ...Rb5-b3-g3. During this time White could probably pick up the a-pawn, and the outcome of the game would probably not have been altered.
42.Kh4 Rc3
43.Nc5! Rxc5
The knight must be taken now, like it or not, but although Black will be a pawn up in the endgame, there is no win.
44.Nd7+ Kd6
45.Nxc5 Kxc5
46.Kg5! ...
Typical of pawn endings. The king, of course, is headed for the h-pawn, but if Black advances his king to d4 instead of b5, then White also keeps the option of taking the f5-pawn first.

124. Smyslov—Euwe
(Reti Opening)
Sacrificing a pawn in order to seize an open line in the center is one of the oldest strategic ideas known: it may be found in the classical games of Greco, Morphy, Anderssen, Chigorin, Spielmann and Alekhine. Occasionally, a pawn is given up to obtain a line for a bishop, the most obvious example being the Danish Gambit: 1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Bc4 cxb2 5.Bxb2. The most promising sacrifices, however, are those which open lines for the rooks, especially when this involves a direct attack on the king. Our forebears knew of another Muzio Gambit besides the usual one, called the “Double (or “Wild”) Muzio”: 1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 g4 5.0-0 gxf3 6.Bxf7+ Kxf7 7.Qxf3, which is occasionally encountered even today. Of course, masters and grandmasters take a rather skeptical attitude toward such play, but it has a sizable following among players of middling strength. For example, this gambit was a most fearsome weapon in the hands of a Moscow first-category player, Volodya Smirnov (whose untimely passing we all mourn), in school and college tournaments, where he employed his own analyses and variations.
But where pieces and pawns were formerly sacrificed on the second or third move, nowadays such early skirmishings in the center are avoided. It’s certainly not because players fear risk — in plain terms, the King’s Indian is a greater risk for Black than the King’s Gambit for White. Nevertheless, not one of us is afraid to play the King’s Indian, while the advocates of the King’s Gambit grow fewer and fewer, as do those of the Scotch, Italian and Vienna Games. The problem with all these openings is that after a short fight in the center, the pawn structure simplifies, and the fight which follows becomes flat and featureless. Players of our day know how to sacrifice a pawn or a piece as well as Morphy or Anderssen did; but it is a characteristic of the present state of the art that sacrifices must be postponed while shielding one’s combinative yearnings behind a mask of positional play.
The Smyslov - Euwe game, filled with combinative ideas that flow organically from the position, deserves to be counted among the finest examples of the art of chess.
1.Nf3 Nf6
2.g3 d5
3.Bg2 Bf5
4.0-0 Nbd7
5.d3 c6
6.Nbd2 h6
With his queen’s pawn supported by 5...c6, it makes more sense to occupy the center with 6...e5. The problem with this move is that his king’s bishop remains shut in behind its own pawns, making it impossible for Black to castle kingside for some time. Smyslov exploits this with his 7.e4! — somewhat later than Morphy was accustomed to play this move, it is true, but with no less effect.
7.e4 dxe4
8.dxe4 Nxe4
9.Nd4 Nxd2
Was it the fear of giving up his two bishops that prevented the former World Champion from playing 9...Nd6, and prompted him instead to develop still another enemy piece? After 9...Nd6 10.Nxf5 Nxf5 11.Re1 g6 12.Ne4, or 11...e6 12.Bh3 Nd6 13.Qh5, White would still have had to prove the correctness of his pawn sacrifice.
10.Bxd2 Bh7
11.Bc3 ...
In the bygone days of chess, when today’s finely-tuned techniques of positional play had not yet been worked out to such a degree, and having a piece or a pawn more was considered the mark of a cad — in those days, I do not doubt that White would, without much hesitation, have sacrificed a knight on c6, and knocked apart the black king’s insecure shelter. The strategic basis for this sacrifice would be the complete isolation of Black’s bishop and rook. Some concrete variations:
I. 11.Nxc6 bxc6 12.Bxc6 Rc8 13.Ba5!
II. 12...Bf5 13.Qf3 Rc8 14.Ba4, following which White would place his rook on d1, obtaining a position very similar to that of the famous game Morphy — Duke of Brunswick and Count Isouard; Black has no way of freeing himself.
The indecisive text turns the game in another direction for a while, and forces Smyslov to put forth a lot of ingenuity later on, in order to create once again the opportunity for a combinative attack.
11...Qc7
12.Qf3 e5
13.Rfe1 0-0-0
14.Nb3 f6
Euwe sets up a pawn chain on the dark squares, without giving a thought to what will protect the light ones — a circumstance Smyslov later exploits beautifully. 14...f5 should have been played at once.
15.Ba5 Nb6
Black overestimates his position and plays too dogmatically, without giving an inch. 15...b6 16.Bc3 Nc5 should have been played. After 17.Nxc5 Bxc5 18.a4 Bd4 19.a5, etc., White would have had some chances, the risks in that case would have been mutual. Now, White home free.
16.c4 Rd3
17.Qh5 Qe7
18.Bf1 g6
It is unpleasant to have to shut in one’s own bishop, but after the rook’s only possible retreat — to d7 — the threat was Bh3, so ...f6-f5 had to be prepared.
19.Qe2 Rd7
20.Qe3 Kb8
21.Rad1 Nc8
Clouds are beginning to gather over the black king’s position. Euwe and Stahlberg’s recommendation of 21...Bg8 would not have made any substantial change in the position: for example, 22.Bxb6 axb6 23.Qxb6 threatens 24.Na5.
22.Bh3 ...
A consequence of 11...f6?: the diagonal h3-c8 is very weak, and so Black, who did not want to play ...f7-f5, must play it now; but now it only half helps.
22...Rxd1
23.Rxd1 f5
24.Bb4! ...
Initiating a series of combinative blows. With this move, White exposes: 1) the insufficiently protected e-pawn, and 2) the weakness of the h-pawn (in the variation 24...Qc7 25.Bxf8 Rxf8 26.Qxh6).
24...Qf6
25.Bc3 Bg7
One more Black retreat: the bishop now no longer controls c5.
26.Nc5 Ka8
On 26...Nb6 there would follow 27.Rd7!, but now the end comes at once.
27.Nxb7 Kxb7
28.Rd7+ Ka8
29.Qc5 ...
This was enough to win, but every chessplayer from beginner to grandmaster would have gotten more enjoyment out of the variation 29.Bg2 Re8 30.Bxe5 Rxe5 31.Qxe5! Qxe5 32.Bxc6+ Kb8 33.Rb7+ Ka8 34.Rb-any (34.Rb6) mate. For the same reason, the prosaic 30.Rxg7 Qxg7 31.Bxc6+ and 32.Bxe8 was not as strong.
29...Nb6
30.Rxg7 Qxg7
31.Bxe5 Qd7
32.Bxh8 ...
An extra pawn plus the two bishops means the outcome of the game is assured. The phase which follows is not especially interesting: here or there Smyslov might have played more accurately, for instance by not exchanging queens.

White has given his opponent a weak pawn on d5, but his plans for the next few moves do not involve an attack on it. White’s play will revolve around the fact that the square in front of the d-pawn has passed completely into his hands, and makes a good base for his pieces: from this square, pieces could exercise strong influence over both wings. A somewhat vague idea, of course; one cannot win a game, even by controlling the best square on the board, without attacking anything from it. In the present game, concrete targets became quite highly visible after Black’s ...g7-g6 and ...f7-f5, but Stahlberg found sufficient defensive resources, one of them being his centralized knight at e4.

White has succeeded in setting up a strong position. He may invade the king’s wing with his queen, setting up threats on the dark squares, or he may precede this by cutting up the kingside pawns with h4-h5. True, the outcome of either course of action is not entirely clear, but in any event White ought not to have submitted to the queen exchange he allows in a few moves. Apparently Geller expected he would win the ending by pure technique, but Stahlberg puts up his usual stubborn defense, attaining an unbreachable position.

ROUND NINETEEN
127. Boleslavsky—Geller
(Sicilian Defense)
Mutual forcing attacking play against opposite-wing castled positions is one of the sharpest forms of the chess struggle. In this it is equally important not to throw oneself too hastily into the attack and not to be excessively concerned with the defense of one’s own king. The harmonious blending of attack and defense, based upon experience, knowledge and intuition, is what we find in this game between two masters of the aggressive style.

11.g4 ...
With his 6...Bg4, Geller forced White to advance his f-pawn to f3; making a virtue of necessity, Boleslavsky then played the Rauzer Attack against his opponent’s Dragon Variation, in which White plays f2-f3 of his own volition.
11...Rc8
12.Kb1 Ne5
13.h4 ...
The position is of exceptional interest, both for theory and for the practice of the middle-game.
White has a powerfully centralized knight, making a good counterweight to the bishop on d7 and ready to meet a queen sortie to a5 by retreating to b3. White started his pawn storm first, and has already gotten in g3-g4 and h2-h4; his own king position has no weaknesses, while Black’s pawn at g6 forms a hook for White’s advancing army to seize upon.
While Black may be starting his pawn advance later than White’s, he already has a line open against the enemy king. His centralized knight is very powerful too: it attacks the weak link in White’s pawn chain— the pawn which is, in fact, the only support of White’s whole chain (and very shaky, too!).
Black controls, and may soon occupy, the important square c4, which carries about the same value as the f5 square does for Black; meanwhile, White still does not control one square in the immediate area of Black’s king. Finally, the powerful bishop at g7 may give rise to dangerous combinations on the long diagonal.
As may be seen, a complex position; at the moment, it lies in a state of dynamic equality. Great skill is necessary in order to maneuver the entire mass of pawns and pieces, while simultaneously countering the enemy’s operations. In this game, we shall follow the struggle move by move.
13...b5
Black answers blow for blow. This prepares ...b5-b4, as well as ...Nc4, after which he could now answer Bxc4 with ...b5xc4, opening the b-file, which is more dangerous to White than the c-file.
14.Bh6 ...
Taking the b-pawn would be madness, of course. And h4-h5 is ineffective, so long as Black’s pieces solidly defend the squares h7 and h8; so first White wants to trade off one of the most important defensive pieces.
14...Bxh6
...Bh8 is sometimes possible in such positions: at the moment, the rook is less valuable than the bishop. The long diagonal, at present loaded with pieces, may be cleared quickly with, for instance, 14...Bh8 15.Bxf8 Rxc3 16.bxc3 Nxf3 17.Nxf3 Nxe4 — not a forced line by any means, and a clear loss for Black here as well, but presented merely as an illustration of the ideas that may come up in the course of battle.
15.Qxh6 Rxc3
h4-h5 was a real threat now, so this exchange of rook for knight, which also breaks up the king’s cover, was practically forced.
16.bxc3 ...
16...Qa5
The natural attacking continuation.
17.Qe3 ...
White’s king position is loosening, and his queen must now return to the defense. On the other hand, the position is still in balance, since White has the exchange as compensation.

Nothing comes of 17...Nc4 18.Bxc4 bxc4 19.Ka1 Rb8 20.Rb1. Now 18...b4 is a threat.
18.h5 b4
19.Qc1 Qxc3
20.Qb2 Rc8
Black refrains from 20...Qe3, which could result in a repetition of moves after 21.Qc1 Qc3. Black has no advantage, and after the exchange of queens his game becomes perhaps even a bit inferior.
21.hxg6 ...
This forces Black to initiate the trade, as 21...hxg6 allows 22.Qc1, with the threat of 23.Qh6.
21...Qxb2+
22.Kxb2 hxg6
23.a3 ...
An inaccuracy, which leads up to Boleslavsky’s following one-move oversight, the only such occurrence in his tournament practice in the last fifteen years. Correct was 23.Bd3 or 23.Be2, and only then 24.a3. In that event, White would have had winning chances.
23...bxa3+
24.Kxa3 ...
Even here, nothing fearsome would have occurred after 24.Ka2, but Boleslavsky bravely follows the variation he calculated: 24...Nxf3 25.Nxf3 Rc3+ 26.Rd3?!?! As Boleslavsky explained it later, he of course saw that the black knight could take the f-pawn, followed by the rook check at c3, forking king and knight; but he thought his 26.Rd3 would protect both attacked pieces — including the king!
24...Nxf3
25.Nxf3 Rc3+
26.Kb2 Rxf3
27.e5 Nxg4
The foundation cracks, and the entire edifice comes tumbling down.
28.Be2 Rf2
29.Bxg4 Bxg4
30.Rdf1 Rxf1
31.Rxf1 dxe5
No rook can fight a bishop and four pawns. If it were not for the a-pawn, perhaps White might scare up some sort of chances, but it will take him a couple of moves to win that pawn, and in that time, the black pawns can go a long way...

8.0-0 Nbd7
9.Qe2 Bg6
10.e4 0-0
11.Bd3 h6
Making a draw with Black sometimes becomes a necessity due to one’s tournament standing or the approach of more important games. When he needed to draw a game, Smyslov used the Slav Defense, and neither Boleslavsky, nor Szabo, nor Stahlberg in this game could make any headway against it.
True, Szabo found the interesting move 11.Bd3, and obtained a significant advantage after 11...Qa5?, but two rounds later Smyslov already had an improvement for Black, 11...h6; and his subsequent maneuver ...Nd7-b8-c6 gave him full equality.
12.Rd1 Qe7
13.h3 Rad8

DRAW
But perhaps not quite so simply as the reader might think. In view of the threatened 28.b5 axb5 29.a6, Black must play 27...Rce8! here, in order to meet 28.b5 axb5 29.a6 with 29...Na5! The exchange sacrifice 28.Rxc6 bxc6 29.Rxc6 would fail to 29...Rc8! 30.Rxa6 Rc2 or 30.Qc3 Rxc6 31.Qxc6 h5!
Thus, White’s relatively best line would be 28.Re3 followed by 29.b5 axb5 30.a6. Sometimes the draw two grandmasters agree to conceals many pretty possibilities.
129. Euwe—Keres
(Grunfeld Opening)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 g6
3.g3 Bg7
4.Bg2 d5
5.cxd5 Nxd5
6.e4 Nb6
7.Ne2 c5
8.d5 e6
Why does Black voluntarily create this breach in his position, as if to invite the further advance of the d-pawn? The answer to this must be sought in Keres’ first few moves. Black’s entire system is aimed at enticing the white pawn to d6, there to be attacked and eliminated. For the time being, White restrains himself long enough to castle; but eventually he decides to exploit this breach in the pawn wall by pushing his pawn to d6. It appears to me that the pleasure of attacking the encircled pawn is won at too great a price: a conclusion which the further course of this game supports.
9.0-0 0-0
10.Nec3 ...
We have seen a similar maneuver in Game 19, Euwe - Smyslov: the knight on b1 stays at home temporarily, so as to come out later at either a3 or d2, or to replace the other knight when it leaves c3, depending upon circumstances.
10...exd5
11.exd5 N8d7
12.Ne4 ...
Now White has an obvious advantage, consisting of the great mobility of his d-pawn by comparison with the clear weakness of the black pawn at c5. In addition, White has more space available for maneuvering.
12...Nf6
13.Nbc3 Nbd7
14.d6 ...
The battle waxes very hot after this pawn’s advance. Trading the c-pawn for the d-pawn would be unfavorable for Black: for example, 13...Nxe4 14.Nxe4! Nxd5 15.Nxc5, and I cannot see how Black is to maintain his position at b7 and d5 without sacrificing either position or material.
14...Rb8
15.Bg5 h6
16.Bxf6 Bxf6
A necessity, and a sad one too, since it will be difficult to fight that passed pawn without his darksquare bishop.
Black’s opening idea has been a fiasco.
17.Nxf6+ Nxf6
18.Re1 Be6
19.Qf3 b5
20.Qf4 Kh7
21.Rad1 Rb6
22.a3 ...
Every positional achievement — in this case, the pawn at d6, which commands the attention of the black pieces — is important, but not so much of itself as in conjunction with other combinative or positional motifs. In the diagrammed position, the motifs for White are:
1) the undefended c5-pawn,
2) the Black king’s weakened cover,
3) the ever-present possibility of the advance d6-d7,
4) control of the c7 and e7 squares; coupled with this, the idea of trying for control of either the c-file or the e-file.
And for Black:
1) the possibility of surrounding the d-pawn from three sides,
2) a queenside majority attack,
3) the possibility of ...Nh5, which would force White’s queen away from its strong position on f4.
It is by means of this matching up and balancing of the chances for both sides that the master generally arrives at more or less objective conclusions, which are called an “evaluation of the position”.
If coefficients could be found for that sort of evaluation, then machines could also play chess.
By now it is clear that White, whose pieces are more actively placed, should try to exploit his opponent’s weaknesses, while not forgetting his main threats. There were two ways for Euwe to accomplish this. One was 22.b3, in order to slow Black’s pawn roller: ...b5-b4, ...c5-c4 and ...c4-c3; but Black’s position would still have been difficult to crack, chiefly due to the bishop at e6. So 22.Rxe6 suggests itself, in order to eliminate the only black piece that has any freedom of action, and thus fling open the door to the black king’s shelter along the seventh rank, while turning Black’s three good pawns at f7, g6 and h6 into two weak ones at e6 and g6. White’s attack could then develop as follows: 22...fxe6 23.Qe5 Qd7 24.Bh3, or 23...Re8 24.Qxc5.
At all events, the text move had little to recommend it. It does nothing to further White’s plans, and needlessly weakens b3. Keres exploits this skillfully.
22...Re8
An excellent defensive maneuver. The bishop threatens to exit to b3, when the rook at d1 will be overburdened, having to defend the d-pawn as well as the king’s rook.
23.Ne4 Nxe4
24.Rxe4 Qd7
Completing the encirclement, and more importantly the blockade, of the d-pawn: without mobility, it holds no further terrors. Meanwhile, the c5-pawn is awakening from its slumber, so Euwe hurries to trade it for the d-pawn before it starts to advance.
25.Qe5 Rd8
26.Qxc5 Rxd6
Now the fire has died, and there is no cause for further argument. The DRAW comes as the natural conclusion to a battle flamed — and faded.
130. Szabo—Reshevsky
(Queen’s Gambit)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6
3.Nf3 d5
4.Nc3 c5
5.cxd5 Nxd5
6.e3 Nc6
7.Bd3 Nxc3
If Black wanted to trade, on c3, he should have played 7...cxd4 first.
8.bxc3 Be7
9.Qc2 g6
Black prepares to castle. Considering White’s threat of Bxh7, this or some other weakening was practically unavoidable, and it is hard to say whether Reshevsky would have had less of a problem after 9...h6. Szabo would then have tried to have his king’s bishop and his queen trade places as quickly as possible, and what would Black do then? Further weakening of his pawn barricade with ...g7-g6 or ...f7-f5 would be fatal, and Black obviously would not have enough time to bring his knight to f8. On the other hand, that same ...Nf8 would be not only his one chance, but his one hope as well. So we must conclude that the combination of 6...Nc6 with 7...Nxc3 was unfortunate. The text move weakens a whole cluster of squares, and gives White the basis for a successful attack.
10.h4 h5
11.Rb1 Rb8
12.Be4 ...
The first consequence of Black’s carelessness: on 12...Bd7, White sacrifices a piece with 13.Bxg6 fxg6 14.Qxg6+ Kf8 15.e4, with the threat of 16.Bh6+.
12...Qc7
13.0-0 Bd7
14.d5 exd5
15.Bxd5 Bf6
16.Ng5 Nd8
17.c4 Bc6

Szabo has obtained an excellent attacking position, while Black’s pieces stand passively, and his king still has not castled.
18...Bg7
19.Bb2 0-0
20.Nf6+ Bxf6?
21.Bxf6 ...
This has not happened in tournament play in a long time: both grandmasters have overlooked a mate in two by 21.Qxg6+ Bg7 22.Qxg7 mate. Black’s only move was 20...Kh8, when White would have continued his attack by 21.f4, followed by f4-f5 or e3-e4-e5, with a relatively easy win. Those with a penchant for beauty might try 21.Qc3, threatening 22.Ne8; 21...Bxd5 would be well met by 22.Nxd5.
21...Bxd5
22.cxd5 Qd6
23.Qc3 Qxd5
24.Rfd1 Qf5
25.e4 Qe6
26.Bg7 b6
White’s position was so powerful that despite his unbelievable oversight on the 21st move, he still has more than enough to win here. Once again, it comes down to a mate threat at g7, for which purpose he need only have retreated his bishop by 27.Bh6. The only reply would be 27...f6, when 28.Qg3 would have won at least a rook.
Szabo played otherwise:
27.Bxf8? Kxf8
immediately saw his error, and became so distraught that, after using up nearly all his remaining time, and still without making a move, he accepted the
DRAW
Reshevsky had offered nearly half an hour before — right after White took the rook at f8 with his bishop. After such a traumatic experience, Szabo was a long time regaining his confidence, which naturally affected his play for the remainder of the tournament.
131. Averbakh—Bronstein

16.b3 h5 17.Nc3 Ned7 18.Re1 Qd8 19.Rab1 Nf8 20.Red1 Qe7
Neither player is putting much life into this well-known and thoroughly analyzed variation: White plays his cards close to the vest, and Black follows his example. Sometimes excessive peaceableness can be justified, but not here.
21.a3 Nfe6 22.h4 Nd7 23.Nxe6 Qxe6 24.Na4 Bf8 25.c5 dxc5 26.Nxc5 Nxc5 27.Bxc5

2.c4 g6
3.Nc3 Bg7
4.e4 d6
5.f3 0-0
6.Be3 e5
7.d5 ...
White is not obliged to close the center: he could also have continued with 7.Nge2 exd4 8.Nxd4 c6 9.Nc2 Re8 10.Qd2 d5 11.0-0-0, which wins the d-pawn eventually, but gives Black the initiative.
7...Nh5
This move is not obligatory either, but a lot of people seem to think that in the King’s Indian the f-pawn must go to f5 as quickly as possible. I don’t believe that’s always true. The ...f7-f5 or ...f7-f5-f4 attack is good, provided it achieves some substantive end; if not, then it’s better to postpone ...f7-f5 until it is most effective. For this reason, 7...Nbd7 and 7...a5 were not at all inferior to the text move.
8.Qd2 f5
9.0-0-0 f4
10.Bf2 Bf6
11.Nge2 Bh4
12.Bg1 g5!
A new move: compare this with Game 75, Geller - Gligoric, in which Black played 12...Nd7, and then pulled his bishop back to e7. Since Black had to endure a long and difficult defense in that game, Gligoric decides to waste no time opening the g-file for kingside counterplay. In reply, Petrosian exploits the knight’s absence from d7 to break on the left flank.
13.c5! g4
14.Kb1 gxf3
15.gxf3 Na6
With part of the board blockaded, Black appears to be all set for the long haul after his ...f5-f4. So there was no reason for haste here, either: the coolheaded 15...Kh8 would have forestalled White’s next threat, and made possible the plan ...Rg8, ...Be7, ...a5 etc.
16.c6 ...
This energetic move secures White’s advantage. If 16...b6, then 17.a3 followed by 18.b4 takes away all the black knight’s squares, and the queen’s bishop’s as well; if 16...bxc6 17.dxc6, when the a2-g8 diagonal is opened, and White’s pieces gain the d5 square, for example: 17...Qe8 18.Nc1 Qxc6? 19.Bb5 Qb7 20.Bxa6 Qxa6 21.Qd5+.
16...Nf6
17.cxb7 Bxb7
18.Ng3 ...
A transparent sacrifice which only slows down the attack. White thinks that his threat of 19.Nf5 will force Black to enter the unfavorable line 18...fxg3 19.hxg3 Bxg3 20.Qg5+ Kh8 21.Qxg3. Gligoric’s quiet reply, however, forces the knight to retreat and try a different route.
18...Bc8
19.Nge2 Nc5
This allows White to dismember Black’s pawn formation totally by trading his bishop for the knight, which leaves Black in a more or less lost position. Black might have exploited his opponent’s loss of time with 19...Nd7, and only then ...Nac5 and ...a5.
20.Bxc5! ...
White instantly exploits his opponent’s inaccuracy.
20...dxc5
21.Nc1 Qe7
22.Nb3 Bd7
Directed against the threatened 23.Na4 and 24.Qc2. However, Petrosian now finds an original queen maneuver to win the c5-pawn.
23.Qg2+! Kh8
24.Qg1 Ne8
25.Qxc5 Nd6
26.Rc1 ...
Petrosian correctly declines the second pawn: after 26.Qxc7 Rfc8 27.Qa5 Bf2! Black would have some serious counterchances.
26...Be8
27.Bh3 a5
Black’s only hope is an attack on White’s king. So he gives up another pawn to open a line and remove one of the pieces covering the king.
28.Nxa5 Bf2
29.Qxf2 Rxa5
30.Rhg1 Bg6
31.Bf1 Rb8
32.Rc2 Nf7
33.h4 Nd6
34.Bd3 Rb4
White plays rather hesitantly in time-pressure (Rh1-g1-c1, Bh3-f1-d3-f1), which, while it does not let the win slip away, still allows his opponent to improve the position of his pieces. The idea of transferring his rook to the fourth rank is very good, but it does not get carried through to its logical conclusion.
35.Rgc1 Rd4
36.Bf1 Qd8
37.Ne2 ...
37...Rda4
During the past fifteen moves Black has tried by every means available to complicate the game, but Petrosian’s solid preventive measures have taken their toll: Gligoric loses faith, and just at the very moment when blind luck offers him an unexpected — I might even say unbelievable — opportunity to complicate, and mix things up. The idea of giving a rook for “only” two pawns with 37...Rxe4 seemed just too risky. But when one sacrifices, one does not count pawns, but rather accrued advantages and concrete variations.
Had Gligoric not lost heart, and found within himself the strength to sacrifice the rook, the continuation might have been very interesting; I am sure that Petrosian would have had reason to regret his carelessness.
First, some considerations of a general nature. After 38.fxe4 Nxe4, the only White reply that makes any sense is 39.Qe1, defending against the newly created threat of 39.-- 39...Nd2+ 40.Ka1 Rxa2+ 41.Kxa2 Qa8 mate. Nor is this all: Black’s queen now takes on d5 (39...Qxd5), and White’s king is quite suddenly and quite obviously in a mating net.
For just one rook (of questionable usefulness), Black clears away all pawn obstructions in the center; along with the three pawns he gets as material compensation, he also obtains two diagonals, one file and a powerful knight in the very middle of the board. White’s material advantage would probably have allowed him to save his king from direct threats, but finding the solution to this task would have presented him no small difficulties.
For those who enjoy complicated, pretty variations, we present a summary analysis, giving a good illustration of the possibilities for both sides in this head-breaking position. (In addition to the author’s variations, we have made use here of those arising from the correspondence polemic between Soviet grandmaster Tigran Petrosian and the Yugoslav master Vukovic, commentator for “Sahovski Glasnik”.
I. 40.b3 Nd2+ 41.Kb2 Rxa2+ 42.Kxa2 Qxb3+ 43.Ka1 Qa3+, and mate next; or 41.Ka1 Nxb3+ 42.Kb2 Nxc1.
II. 40.b4 Nd2+ 41.Ka1 Nb3+ 42.Kb1 Rxa2 43.Kxa2 (43.Nxf4 Nd2+ 44.Qxd2 Qb3 mate!) 43...Nxc1+ 44.Ka1 Qa8+ 45.Kb1 Qa2+!
III. 40.a3 Nd2+ 41.Ka1 Nb3+ 42.Kb1 Nxc1 43.Nxc1 Rc5 44.Bd3 Bxd3 45.Nxd3 Qxd3 46.Qe2 Qxe2 47.Rxe2 Kg7 48.b4 Rd5, or:
a) 43.Kxc1 Bxc2 44.Kxc2 Qe4+
b) 43.Qxc1 Qb3 44.Qd2 Rd5 45.Qc1 Qxc2+ 46.Qxc2 Rd1+
IV. 40.Qxa5 Qxa5 41.Ka1 f3 42.Nc3 Ng3 43.Rf2 e4.
Of course Gligoric could not calculate all of these variations through in time-pressure, and therefore was unable to bring himself to give up a rook on “spec”. On the other hand, considering that Black ended up resigning the game four moves later, the rook doesn’t appear to have been worth keeping.
38.Nc3 Rd4
39.b3 ...
whether by intuition or by conscious choice, Petrosian is not about to allow Black to play something as tempting as ...Rxe4 twice. In the game of chess as in life, opportunity knocks but once.
39...Qb8
40.h5 Bxh5
41.Qh4 ...
and Gligoric
RESIGNED
After 41...Bg6 42.Qf6+ and 43.Qxe5, Black’s entire pawn chain is destroyed, while after 41...Qe8 there would follow Bf1-h3-e6, followed by rook to g2.

Weakening the h1-a8 diagonal is not a good idea for White: driving out the knight did not require such strong measures. Within two moves, Najdorf gives up a pawn in order to enforce an exchange of queens; then, his two bishops restore approximate equality.
20...Ng6
21.g3 Bxd4!
That’s the point! If the rook takes, Black gets his main reserve, the e-pawn, very successfully into the fray with a sudden onslaught against White’s king: 22.Rxd4 e5 23.R4d1 Rxc3! 24.Rxc3 exf4 — you need only set up this position to understand why White hurriedly recaptured with the pawn, and then closed the bishop’s diagonal with d4-d5.

Black might also have been tempted to set up a death-dealing battery against White’s king with 23...Ba8, threatening 24...Qb7.

Black’s extra pawn is of no significance, so the draw is foreordained. By continuing his stubborn pursuit of the win, Taimanov gets into an inferior position. But after some small agitation, everything comes out all right in the end.

ROUND TWENTY
134. Taimanov—Petrosian
(Nimzoindian Defense)
One of the tournament’s most beautiful games, in which White, without resorting to a pawn storm, managed to break down a solid defensive position by combinative means.
The reader will note that this is not the first time we have referred to a game as being “one of the most beautiful of the tournament”. Indeed, a great number of beautiful games were produced here. True beauty in chess can only be a creation by both players: should one player’s mastery of the game considerably exceed that of his opponent, the resulting creation cannot afford us complete esthetic satisfaction.
There were only three brilliancy prizes given at the Zurich tournament; but even if there had been ten times that many, the jury could still have found worthy recipients for them.

10.cxd5 exd5
A defensive system that saw a lot of use in this event — in Games 12, 71, 102 and 160, for example. In each case, Black found sufficient counterchances, thanks to his extra queenside pawn.
In this game, Taimanov spends two moves in order to trade off the black queen’s knight, which enables him to carry out his intended f2-f3 and e3-e4 quickly, by eliminating the pressure on the d4-pawn.
11.Ne5 Qc7
12.Nxc6 Qxc6
13.f3 Be6
14.Qe1 Nd7
15.e4 ...
In no other Nimzo-Indian was White able to get in e3-e4 so quickly and effectively, opening diagonals for both his bishops at once. The slightest misstep from Black could result in his king’s falling under a powerful attack — Qh4 is already threatened.
15...c4
Petrosian decides to turn to defense exclusively, based upon the strong point at e6. This decision was not at all forced: using his temporary lead in development and the central pawn tension, he might have stirred up sharp play by means of 15...f5.
For example:
I. 16.exd5 Qxd5 17.Be3 Ne5 — 17...f4 and 17...cxd4 are good too.
II. On 16.e5, Black has kept the c4 square open for his knight, and would reply 16...b5, with the threat of ...Nd7-b6-c4.
III. Perhaps Petrosian disliked the continuation 16.c4 fxe4 17.fxe4 dxc4 18.d5, but this is not dangerous for Black either, after 18...Qd6:
a) 19.Bxc4 Ne5 20.Be2 Bg4 21.Bb2 Bxe2 22.Qxe2 Rae8, and the white pawns are blockaded;
b) 19.dxe6 Qxd3 20.exd7 Rxf1+ 21.Qxf1 Qd4+;
c) Black would get a tremendous attack after 19.Rxf8+ Rxf8 20.dxe6 Ne5, when the bishop cannot retreat to b1 or e2 (21.Be2) because of 21...Qd4+, while if it retreats to f1 or c2 (21.Bc2), then 21...Ng4, and I see no way of stopping both 22...Qxh2 mate and 22...Qd4+.
16.Bc2 f5
17.e5 Rf7
18.a4 a5
19.f4 b5
White has a clear plan of attack: h3, Kh2, Rg1, g4, Qg3 or Qh4, and Black cannot meet this on the kingside in any way. Petrosian’s attempt to divert his opponent with his extra queenside pawn is understandable, but now a breach appears in his fortress, through which the enemy bishops will assail Black’s position from the flank, while the queen and the other rook continue their frontal assault.

5.Nc3 d6
6.Bg5 e6
7.Qd2 a6
8.0-0-0 Bd7
The starting point for much theoretical research. Latest analyses give White the nod, perhaps without sufficient grounds for doing so. The point of Black’s defense 7...a6 and 8...Bd7 is that with the white queen on d2 and bishop on g5, Black always has the stroke ...Nxe4 available.
9.f4 ...
It is difficult to get any sort of attack against the Sicilian without this move, but now comes the main variation of Black’s defense.
9...h6
10.Bh4 Nxe4
11.Qe1 ...
This move was discovered not too long ago — perhaps fifteen years back. 11.Bxd8 Nxd2, etc., was formerly considered obligatory, but that gives Black an excellent endgame. Retreating the queen to e1 opened up new possibilities for further creativity on both sides.
11...Nf6
12.Nf5 Qa5
In days of yore, people were not as preoccupied with pawns as they are today, counting them up after every half-move — no, pawns used to be sacrificed at the drop of a hat for various, occasionally questionable and even dubious ends. Even then, however, they were not given away. Steinitz, for example, used to suffer an awful lot for the chance to hang on to, and then bring home, one extra pawn. He probably would not have parted quite so lightly with his d-pawn; on the other hand, one may sympathize with Averbakh’s distaste for 12...Qc7, since after 13.Bxf6 gxf6 14.Nd5, the queen has to lose a tempo and retreat to d8: a prospect unlikely to appeal to anyone. However, positions do occur whose solution lies precisely in such a
modus operandi
— could this be one such? At any rate, after 14...Qd8 I see no immediate dangers for Black, and perhaps he will be able to rid himself of the e-file pin with the curious move ...Nc6-e5!
13.Nxd6+ Bxd6
14.Rxd6 0-0-0
15.Qd2 ...
The game immediately loses all interest for theory and goes into the trenches for a war of maneuver, where neither side wants to undertake any active plan.
15.Bxf6 gxf6 16.Qh4 is very interesting here, but I believe the strongest course would be the simple retreat of the rook from d6 to d2. Only after seeing Black’s reply should White decide whether he will play on the black pawn weaknesses after Bxf6 or keep this bishop for an attack on the squares round about the black king. Lately this variation has become the rage.
15...Ne7 16.Bd3 Bc6 17.Rxd8+ Rxd8 18.Rd1 Qh5 19.g3 Nf5 20.Bxf6 gxf6 21.Qf2 Nd4 22.Be4 Qc5 23.Kb1 f5 24.Bxc6 Qxc6 25.a3 Qf3 26.Qg1
Can one possibly hope to win a game by such moves? Gligoric remains true to himself: not one unnecessary pawn move; but this occasionally gives his play an excessively cautious turn. It is no surprise that this game is shortly drawn.

136. Bronstein—Szabo
(Nimzoindian Defense)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6
3.Nc3 Bb4
4.Nf3 c5
5.e3 0-0
6.Be2 ...
Since the main variation with 6.Bd3 gives White neither the push e3-e4 nor a mating attack on the b1-h7 diagonal, he leaves the d-file open.
6...d5
7.0-0 Nc6
8.cxd5 ...
This trade reveals White’s intentions:
I. 8...Nxd5 9.Nxd5 exd5 10.a3 Ba5 11.dxc5
II. 8...Nxd5 9.Nxd5 Qxd5 10.a3 Ba5 11.dxc5 Qxc5 12.b4.
Black must therefore submit to an isolated pawn, which gives White a small but secure advantage after 8...exd5 9.dxc5 Bxc5 10.a3 or 10.b3. The author’s idea was adopted successfully by Gligoric in a later game against Euwe.
8...cxd4
9.dxc6 dxc3
10.Qb3 ...
Every chess primer teaches the importance of controlling the long diagonal, which is why neither side wishes to capture the other’s b-pawn. However, White is a move ahead, and Szabo, like it or not, must finally give way.
10...Qe7
It would have been better to maintain the symmetry by the sacrifice of a pawn with 10...Qb6. Now White secures a sizable advantage with a curious knight maneuver.
11.Ne5 Bd6
12.Nc4 cxb2
13.Bxb2 Bc5
Now that the position has opened up, it would make no sense at all for Black to give up his better bishop for the knight.
14.Bf3 Nd5
15.Ne5 bxc6
16.e4 ...
Taking on c6 with the knight was better, leaving Black’s queen with no good square: 16.Nxc6 Qd6 17.e4 or 16...Qc7 17.Bxd5 exd5 18.Qc3. I failed to see that, on 16...Qg5, 17.h4 wins.
16...Nf6
17.Rfc1 Bd7

30.Rxd7 Rxd7

32...Qd7
33.Rc1 Rxc1
34.Bxc1 Bd4
35.e5 ...
A pawn sacrifice to keep the initiative. Black’s sole weakness is the a-pawn, so Black’s bishop must be pulled off the g1-a7 diagonal at any cost.
35...Bxe5
36.Be3 Nc8
37.a4 ...
It is very important for White that he get this pawn to a5, depriving Black’s pieces of the square b6. Black puts his bishop on b8 in order to free his knight on c8 — but that’s six of one, half a dozen of the other...
37...Bb8
38.a5 Nd6
After 37...Ne7 38.Bb7, the a-pawn would fall; now the knight gets pinned again.
39.Bf4 f6
40.Qd3+ Kg8
41.a6 ...
Nailing the a7-pawn in place. Now the outcome of’ the game hinges on whether White has the means to prevent ...e6-e5.

137. Reshevsky—Euwe
(Nimzoindian Defense)
In Game 17 against Averbakh, Reshevsky was unable to solve his defensive problems in the opening; so he decided to employ a similar system here as White. He had to wait quite a while — from the third to the twentieth round — since no one wanted to play the main-line Nimzo-Indian against him.
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6
3.Nc3 Bb4
4.e3 c5
5.Bd3 d5
6.Nf3 0-0
7.0-0 Nc6
8.a3 Bxc3
9.bxc3 dxc4
10.Bxc4 Qc7
11.Re1 e5
Reshevsky played 11...Rd8 against Averbakh, in order to prevent 12.d5, but Euwe does not consider this push to be dangerous, and he may be right.
12.d5 e4
Euwe had an energetic counterblow ready, but there was no need for it. Simply moving the knight to a5 would have left the d5-pawn in a precarious position, cut off from its own camp. For example, 12...Na5 13.d6 Qc6 14.Nxe5 Qe4 recovers the pawn with good play. Also possible is Euwe’s postmortem suggestion of 13...Qb6 14.Nxe5 Nxc4 15.Nxc4 Qa6.
13.dxc6 exf3
14.Qxf3 Bg4
15.Qg3 Qxc6
White holds his usual small positional advantage in this variation: a kingside pawn majority, which can drive the black knight from f6, after which the bishop-pair will have attacking prospects against the king. As for Black’s extra pawn on the queenside, that must wait for an endgame.
16.e4 Bh5
17.e5 Nd5
18.a4 a6
Euwe resolutely undertook the maneuver ...Bg4-h5-g6 in order to cover his king, anticipating the coming attack; but then he failed to carry it through, beginning another plan instead: ...a7-a6 and ...b7-b5. The bishop, left untended, allows White the opportunity for an interesting maneuver of his own. Better to complete one plan (by playing ...Bg6 now or after ...Nc7) before beginning another.
19.a5 b5
20.axb6 Nxb6
21.Rxa6 Rxa6
22.Bxa6 ...
Not everyone would decide to take such a pawn: after 22...c4, 23...Nd5 is threatened, or 23...Ra8, and the bishop might disappear in a wink. But Reshevsky is prepared, if he sees a chance to win, to think it over for two hours and twenty-five minutes, if it means he will then be able to exploit that chance and fashion a win out of it.
22...c4
23.Qh4 ...
Thus, Reshevsky exploits the undefended black bishop. If now 23...Bg6 24.Be3, and Black will be in trouble; so Euwe forces matters.
23...Ra8
24.Be3 h6
25.Qxh5 Rxa6
26.Bd4 Nd5
Now the game enters a new phase, wherein Black, despite his pawn minus, has fair drawing chances, especially if the queens are exchanged. The problem for White is that he only has one bishop now, and that one not the better of the two, since his pawns stand on dark squares; additionally, White has a weak pawn at c3, and Black has the more active rook.
White, in turn, can prepare and carry out a maneuver to extend his bishop’s diagonal: pushing his e-pawn to e6 when the time is right. This advance will be even stronger if the f-pawn gets to f5 first.
These are the underlying motifs of the struggle that follows.
27.Qg4 Qe6
28.Qf3 Ne7
29.h3 ...
Rather slow: invading b7 immediately with the queen promised more.
29...Qd5
Now White must trade, since 30...Rg6 is threatened. After the exchange of queens, Black’s task is much simplified.
30.Qxd5 Nxd5
31.g3 Nc7
This destroys the fruits of his dogged defense. The obvious 31...Ra3 would have yielded sizable drawing chances. Euwe gives the following variation: 31...Ra3 32.e6 fxe6 33.Rxe6 Nxc3 34.Re7 Kf8! 35.Bc5! Ra5! 36.Rc7+ Kg8 37.Bb4 Ra1+ 38.Kg2 Nd5, which secures Black the draw.
32.Rb1 ...
This flanking maneuver and subsequent infiltration of the rook to the seventh rank decides the game in short order.
32...Ne6
33.Rb8+ Kh7
34.Rc8 Ra4
35.Be3 Ng5
36.Kg2 Ne4
37.Bd4 Nd2

This breakthrough, properly timed, sets up an irresistible threat of mate.

12.0-0 Nxc3
13.Qxc3 b6
14.Ne5 ...
The exchange of bishops and knights has simplified Black’s position; now, by preparing ...c6-c5, he wishes to solve Black’s basic problem in the Orthodox Defense: the development of his queen’s bishop. White has several different ways to proceed here. One good line involves placing his rook on e1, and pushing his e-pawn to e4, meeting ...c5 with d4-d5. He may also retreat the bishop to a2, and bring his rooks to the c-file. Keres likes to set his knights in central positions, and occasionally succeeds with an attack based on such favorable placement.
Exchanging knights at e5 might tempt Black — in fact, if all the pieces could be cleared from the board then, the pawn ending would be much superior for him, perhaps even a win, thanks to his three-to-two on the queen-side. However, no one has yet found the way to remove all the pieces. After 14...Nxe5 15.dxe5 Bb7 16.Rd6, White occupies d6 and the rest of the file as well. The exchange of rooks could only take place on d6 after that, and White would recapture with his pawn, obtaining a powerful passed pawn.
So Black develops his bishop first, which creates a threat to trade knights, since after 14...Bb7 15.Ba2 Nxe5 16.dxe5 Rad8!, for instance, the d-file would become a trading-ground.
14...Bb7
15.f4 Nxe5
16.fxe5 c5
Certainly the opening has been a success for Black: having secured full equality, he now enters an engrossing full-scale battle, despite the rather slim material available. He has two open files at his disposal (c-and d-), while White has only one (the f-).
Open files are important when they contain targets, or when they serve as avenues of communication for the transfer of pieces, usually rooks, to the main theater of action. In this case, the f-file satisfies both conditions; more importantly, however, it lies close to the king, which makes Stahlberg nervous.
The Swedish grandmaster decides to swing his bishop over to the defense of the king’s wing via e4, and thereafter to concentrate on his attack against the d-pawn and on using the c-file for flanking maneuvers against the white king. Such a plan is certainly feasible, but I do think Black would have obtained more from the position if he had exchanged on d4 immediately, and then tried to invade the second rank with his rooks. His threats against g2 might have curtailed the activities of the white rooks.
17.Qe1 Be4
18.Rf4 Bg6
19.h4 cxd4
20.exd4 Rac8
21.Qe2 Rc7
Naturally, it would have made no sense for Black to trade off his bishop with 21...Bh5 22.Qxh5 Rxc4, since that piece traveled here for the express purpose of protecting his king. After 23.Rd3, white’s attack gets there first.
22.Rdf1 ...
22...h5
Such moves can and should only be played when there is no longer any other way to defend the king. Here Black had wholly sufficient — and not quite so violent — means: 22...Rec8 23.Ba6 Rc2 24.Qf3 Rf8, and if 25.h5 Bf5 26.g4 Qh4.
23.R1f3 Rec8
24.Bd3 Bxd3
25.Rxd3 g6
Black’s pawn at h5 has drawn the g-pawn after it, and already white’s pieces are preparing to invade on the weakened squares h6, g5 and f6.
26.Rg3 Kh7
Now the forcing play begins: 27.Qxh5 was threatened, and White’s next move sets up the threat of 28.Rxh5+.
27.Rg5 Qf8
28.Qe4 Qh6
29.d5 ...
Keres rushes to crown his heavy-piece attack with this pawn breakthrough, but in so doing, he gives his opponent a counterchance. 29.Rf6 was correct, nailing the kingside down, after which there would no longer be a defense to the threat of 30.Qf4 and 31.d5!
29...exd5
30.Qxd5 Qf8
31.e6 ...
31...Qc5+
Psychologically speaking, one can understand why Black should seize the first opportunity to exchange queens and rid himself of white’s mating threats, but the resulting endgame is hopeless for him. 31...f5 instead would have given him good drawing chances.
In order to keep his attack from flickering out, Keres would probably have sacrificed a rook at f5, but after 32.Rfxf5 gxf5 33.Rxh5+ Kg6 34.Rg5+ Kh6, White appears to have no better move than 35.Qf3, when Black could reply 35...Rc1+ 36.Kh2 Qd6+ 37.g3 Qd2+, forcing an approximately even ending after 38.Kh3 Qxg5 39.hxg5+ Kxg5 40.e7 Rh8+ 41.Kg2 Rc2+ 42.Kg1 Rc1+, etc.

(King’s Indian)
1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 g6 3.Bf4 Bg7 4.Nbd2 d6 5.h3 0-0 6.e3
An unusual system against the King’s Indian, which Smyslov employs whenever he does not want to give Black the slightest chance of obtaining an initiative. White firmly anchors his d4-pawn, and controls e5 three times, preventing Black from carrying out the traditional King’s Indian advance, ...e7-e5. 5.h3 is thrown in to safeguard the queen’s bishop against possible exchange via ...Nh5.
In this game, Boleslavsky demonstrates the best method of combating this solid, although rather indolent, system: he plays ...c7-c5, occupies the c-file, and builds a barricade of pawns before the darksquare bishop. Any other course would have left Black in the throes of a positional squeeze.
6...c5 7.Be2 Nc6 8.Bh2

13...Nxe5
14.dxe5 Qxe5
15.e4 ...
A sharp and original idea: exploiting the bishop’s temporary-position at g4 to push his pawn to e4 without the support of his minor pieces. White could rightfully lay claim to a strategic victory — if he could also secure the advance of his f-pawn two squares. However, since he has to keep f2-f3 in reserve in order to prevent Black from picking off the e-pawn, White’s only pawn in the center will be pretty shaky. This shows, for instance, in the fact that White cannot reply to Black’s next move, 15...Rfe8, with the natural 16.Re1 in view of 16...Nxe4! 17.f3 Qxc3 18.Qxc3 Nxc3 19.Rxe8+ Rxe8 20.fxg4 Re1+ 21.Kf2 Re2+ 22.Kf3 Rxa2. In this 1ine, 20...Nxa2, recommended by some commentators, does not work, since White, instead of taking the knight, plays 21.Bd2!, when the knight remains trapped.
15...Rfe8

This would have some point, if there were any way at all of enforcing f2-f4.
16...Rad8
17.f3 Bd7
18.Bb2 Bc6
19.Ba2 Nh5
20.Rad1 Nf4

While White has spent his time maneuvering bishops, Black has brought his knight to a strong position. The laws of chess allow that it may be driven off with a pawn move, but the laws of strategy categorically forbid such a move as 21.g3, since this would fatally weaken the second rank. Thus, White should have begun thinking about maintaining equality here by playing 21.Bc1 since, to White’s great good fortune, 21...Bb5 still does not work.
Geller is unwilling to believe that he does not have the better game, and so he seeks to gain the upper hand on the d-file, which allows Kotov to carry out a beautiful combination on the themes of deflection of the queen and cooperation of queen and knight. We have already mentioned that queen and knight can sometimes be stronger than queen and bishop, and occasionally they are no weaker than queen and rook. This will be easier to comprehend if one bears in mind that the bishop’s capabilities parallel the queen’s, while the knight’s complement them.
21...Ba4
Prelude. This drives the queen into a dark cell, where it may be attacked by a knight from either d3 or e2.
22.Qc1 Qg5
Now the threat is 23...Rxd2 and 24...Nh3+. If 23.Kh1, then 23...Nd3, and White has to give up the exchange.
23.Bd5 Nxd5
Black has the better position, and now wins a pawn. He might have tried to exploit the active position of his pieces another way, by 23...Rxd5 24.exd5 Re2, etc.

However, he could still have traded queens, but without capturing the c-pawn immediately, continuing instead with 32...Kf8 33.Be3 b6 34.Bf4 Ke7 35.Bb8 Kd7, and if the bishop takes the pawn now (36.Bxa7), 36...Kc7 catches it!

Black has resolved all of his opening problems well; the only thing left to do now is develop his queen’s knight so that he can get into the fight for the c- and d-files. Desiring complications, White plays the double-edged 15.b4, with the idea of getting his knight to c5; however, this allows Black the opportunity to invade at c4. Play now revolves around the following themes: the control and occupation of c4 and c5, the opposition of the bishops on the long diagonal, and the control of the open files.
15.b4 Qe7 16.a3 Rfd8 17.Qc2 Nbd7 18.Nb3 Rac8 19.Rfd1 Nd5
Is it possible that Smyslov actually thought he was winning the pinned white knight? Kotov, unable to believe his eyes, spent forty minutes in thought before taking off the knight with his rook.
20.Rxd5 Bxc3
Smyslov does not see that he is losing two pieces for a rook. The knight had to be removed by other means: 20...Rxc3 21.Bxc3 Bxd5. White would not relish 21.Rxd7 Rxc2 22.Rxe7 Rxb2 23.Rxb7 Rxb3, as this would come nearer to favoring Black. white’s best line would be 20...Rxc3 21.Bxc3 Bxd5 22.Bxg7 Kxg7 23.Rc1, maintaining some advantage.
21.Rxd7! Rxd7
Smyslov had seen 21.Rxd7, of course; what he probably had not seen was that 21...Bxb2 is met by 22.Rxd8+.

10.Bc2 c5
11.d4 Qc7
12.Nbd2 Rd8
Introducing a variation Keres prepared especially for this game. The point behind this move is that on 12...Bb7 White usually closes up the center with 13.d5, leaving the bishop nothing better to do than return to c8. After 12...Re8 13.dxe5 dxe5 is possible, when the black rook eventually goes to the d-file. But after this move it would make no sense at all for White to play either 13.d5 (while the bishop still stands on c8) or 13.dxe5 (since the rook is already on the d-file). So instead White continues the traditional knight’s tour, from b1 via d2 and f1 to g3 to g3.
13.Nf1 d5!
And here is the novelty Keres prepared. The position this creates cannot be exhaustively analyzed, since every move gives rise to three or four different possibilities, none worse than any other. So a calculation five moves deep would entail checking out around twenty thousand variations, stopping periodically along the way to decide whether this or that intermediate position would favor one side or the other. Such a calculation could probably be performed only by a computer — but a computer does not possess intuition.
If we try to evaluate the position on the basis of general principles, we conclude that White has good attacking chances: both his bishops, both his knights, and his queen can be mobilized quickly to the battlefield, while the rook hinders the black king’s flight. There are only two tactical counter-chances for Black that we can see: his queen attacks the bishop on c2, and his rook may eventually threaten the white queen.
Therefore, there has to be a line White can play that will give these possibilities concrete expression. In that case, why does 12...Rd8, and the whole variation, deserve an exclamation mark? It’s for Keres’ astute psychological preparations. Knowing beforehand what line was to be played, he set Boleslavsky the sort of problem that would be very difficult to solve over the board. Under these circumstances, Keres ran no great risk of losing, while his winning chances were very good indeed.
14.exd5 ...
Master Vasiukov later suggested a clever solution: 14.dxe5 dxe4 15.N1d2! exf3 16.exf6 Bxf6 17.Qxf3 Be6 18.Ne4 Be7 19.Qh5, or 14...Nxe4 15.Ne3! Be6 16.Qe2.

15.cxd4 Nxd5
16.Qe2 Bb7
17.Ng3 cxd4
18.Nxd4 ...
Many commentators thought this move a waste of time, and recommended 18.Nf5 instead; but after 18...Bb4 it is not clear just how White is to continue the attack, not just for the sake of attacking, but in order to win. There was a loss of time, true, but not here; 16.Qe2, as played, instead of the correct 16.Ng5.
18...g6
Simple and good. White threatened to bring in his knights at f5 or h5, and then to reinforce them with the queen. By this one modest move, Keres immediately solves several defensive problems by depriving White’s pieces of the f5 and h5 squares. Bear in mind that White’s advantage is of a temporary sort, and that if it is not put into some concrete form within the next two or three moves, Black will bring up his reserve (the knight on a5) to solidify his king’s position. After Black’s powerful move, I don’t believe Boleslavsky had any way to continue his attack other than 19.Ndf5! If Black takes the knight, he:
1) opens the g-file,
2) opens the b1-h7 diagonal,
3) lets the queen get to h5, and most importantly,
4) must tolerate a white knight at f5 anyway!
If Black could defend himself successfully in this line, then already there was nothing to be done for White! But in that case Keres would also have had no easy time of it, whereas here White’s game worsens move by move.

143. Stahlberg—Reshevsky
(King’s Indian)
Even among the strongest of the contemporary masters, we still find the sort of player who is far stronger with the white pieces than with the black. With Black, such a player thinks about getting a draw from the opening moves. When he has White, certain positions inspire in him flights of fancy, and a desire to win at any cost; when he has Black, the same positions seem to inspire nothing but boredom, and calculations aimed at “equalizing”. This quality is a strong characteristic in Reshevsky, which the reader will note for himself from a study of his games. I will mention only this statistic: in this tournament, Reshevsky won seven games with White, lost only one and drew six; while with Black, he could only win one, losing three and drawing ten!
In the present game Reshevsky played dull chess, not even attempting to make use of the counterchances inherent in the King’s Indian Defense.
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.g3 Bg7 4.Bg2 0-0 5.Nc3 d6 6.Nf3 Nbd7 7.0-0 e5 8.e4 exd4 9.Nxd4 Re8 10.h3 Nc5 11.Re1 a5 12.Qc2 Ng4
Up to here, everything has gone according to theory. In Game 131, Averbakh - Bronstein, White continued 13.Rd1. After the text move, 13.Nb3, Reshevsky could have stirred up a sharp fight with 13...Ne5.
13.Nb3 Nxb3 14.axb3 Ne5 15.Be3 Nc6 16.Rad1 Nb4 17.Qc1
17.Qd2 was much more active here, intending f2-f4 and Qf2.

DRAW
144. Euwe—Bronstein
(Dutch Defense)
1.d4 e6
2.c4 f5
What else but 2...f5 against the Dutch champion? However, this failed to surprise him; after a few introductory moves the game took on the aspect of a theoretical discussion.
3.g3 Nf6
4.Bg2 Be7
5.Nf3 0-0
6.0-0 d6
7.Nc3 Qe8
8.Re1 ...
An old continuation which has been resurrected, thanks to the discovery of the rook sacrifice at e4.
8...Qg6
9.e4 ...
Some theoreticians believe this move opens the e-file; chess practitioners, however, know that two files are opened: the e-file for White and the f-file for Black as well. The player who is the first to reap some tangible benefit from “his” file gains the initiative.
9...Nxe4
10.Nxe4 fxe4
11.Rxe4 ...
11...e5
Of course Black will not take the rook (11...Qxe4? 12.Nh4!), sacrificing a pawn instead, for the sake of quick development. The correctness of the sacrifice would be fully tested, not by its acceptance, but by the quiet retreat 12.Re1; however, White has other ideas.
12.Qe2 Bf5
13.Nh4 ...
Euwe probably underestimated Black’s position. White’s desire to trade off one of the bishops is wholly understandable, but the rook will not be well placed at h4.
13...Bxh4
14.Rxh4 Nc6
White’s position is now a trifle difficult. If he gives up his fianchettoed bishop for the black knight, his light squares will become weak, but how else can he defend the d4 square? 15.Be3 seems the simplest solution, but after 15...Bd3 16.Bd5+ Kh8, Black would have the initiative. White decides to exchange pawns.
15.dxe5 dxe5
After playing the opening sharply, Black is unable to make the switch to positional chess quickly enough; the knight recapture, followed by ...Rae8, was better.
16.Be3 Rad8
17.Bc5 Rfe8
18.Bd5+ ...
White’s bishops have found the opportunity to display their powers.
18...Kh8
19.Qh5 ...
A prelude to interesting complications.
19...Qxh5
20.Rxh5 g6
21.Rxf5! gxf5
22.Bf7 ...
Now Black faces a difficult decision: which of the white bishops is more valuable? After lengthy consideration, he decided to take the darksquare bishop, chiefly because of the possibility of invading at d2 with his rook.
22...Re7
23.Bxe7 Nxe7
24.Bh5 ...
The only possibility. Now 24...Rd2 would be met by 25.Rd1, and if 25...Rxb2 26.Rd7. The question is whether Black will have time to play ...e4 and bring his king directly to the center via g7-f6-e5. He begins this plan with great expectations, but meets with a clever riposte.
24...Nc6
25.Rd1 Nd4
26.Re1 e4
The thought of accepting the repetition by 26...Nc6 27.Rd1 Nd4 28.Re1 was repellent, but Euwe elegantly demonstrates that this courageous pawn push also cannot alter the outcome.
27.f3 Nc2
28.Rc1 ...
DRAW
The invasion at c2 with the knight was thoughtless, of course. Time-pressure was not a factor yet, and there was no reason for me to suppose that Euwe had decided to hand me the game with his 27.f3. Indeed, after 27...Nc2 28.Re2 is bad because of 28...Rd1+; consequently, I should have given more thought to 28.Rc1. Instead, I glanced over two variations: 28.Rc1 Rd2 29.fxe4 fxe4, and 28.Rc1 e3 29.Rxc2 Rd1+ 30.Kg2 Rd2+ Both seemed to have their good points, and so I decided to postpone the final decision until after White’s reply.
The choice, however, turned out to be a difficult one. In the first line, after 30.Rd1!, White gets the better endgame; in the second line, after 31.Rxd2 exd2, the d-pawn never queens at all, as Black hoped, in view of the simple 32.f4, when White still has his bishop, while Black no longer has his knight. So 28...Nb4 would probably have been correct, but after that it would have been White’s turn to assume the offensive. Quite evidently, Euwe was feeling peaceable that day. All’s well that ends well.
145. Szabo—Gligoric
(English Opening)
Saying something like “the contemporary way of handling the opening” still does not explain how the opening was played. Sometimes, the opening is sharp, and the first mistake decides the outcome. In this case, both sides reveal their plans at the outset: one attacks, let’s say, on the kingside, while the other does the same on the queenside. This has always been one of the most popular scenarios, in our day as much as it was in the past.
In the present game, we meet a new approach, one which has begun appearing relatively recently in tournaments, and which Konstantinopolsky aptly termed “the clash of openings. Both sides bring their troops out according to a chosen scheme, making no contact with the opposition for the moment, and in most cases not crossing the demarcation line between the fourth and fifth ranks.
Such an unhurried attitude, however, frequently foreshadows an interesting game — as it does here.

9.h3 Ne8
10.g4 Nc7
11.f4 Rb8
A position has been reached which is reminiscent of a Closed Sicilian, with the only difference being that the pawn on c2 has jumped to c4. white’s pawns occupy good starting positions for a strong attack on the king. As soon as Szabo plays his 12.f5, Black plays his 12...b5, and — they’re off!
12.f5 b5
13.Nxb5 Nxb5
14.cxb5 Rxb5
15.Nc3 Rb8
16.g5 Ne5
On d4 this knight would have blockaded the base of the white pawn chain and controlled more important squares than it does here. Among other things, it would have made White’s next move impossible, and forced Szabo to decide what he wants to do with his f-pawn.
17.Nd5 e6
18.f6 exd5
19.fxg7 ...
The reader who is thoroughly acquainted with opening theory will recall this little combination” of White’s without difficulty as being similar to one that occurred in a game Milner-Barry - Gapablanca. In a similar position, Black recaptured on g7, but some Moscow players later showed that ...Re8 (19...Re8) would have been better. Perhaps that would have been the better move here as well; if then 20.d4 cxd4 21.Qxd4 dxe4 (instead of 21...Qb6) with good counterplay.
19...Kxg7
20.d4 ...
An energetic move in Szabo’s characteristic style, leading to a favorable ending for White.
20...cxd4
21.Qxd4 Qb6
The exchange of queens is Black’s best defense — but not on b6. Why not the maneuver 21...Qc8 (threatening 22...Bxh3) 22.Kh2 Qc4, winning a tempo for Black?
22.Qxb6 Rxb6
23.exd5 Bf5
24.b3 f6
25.Be3 Rb7
26.gxf6+ Kxf6
27.Rac1 ...
White can now strike a positional balance: he has the open c-file, the two bishops, and an extra pawn on the queenside; Black has a strongly centralized knight and an extra pawn on the kingside. White will have the easier time trying to turn his advantages to account, if only because, in such positions:
1) the two bishops can do more than bishop and knight, even when the knight is centralized;
2) white’s passed pawn on the a- or b-file will be more dangerous than Black’s, since the latter can easily be stopped by the white king;
3) the relative weakness of Black’s a- and d-pawns will be of no small significance.
27...Re8
28.Rc3 Rbe7
29.Bd4 Kg5
30.Rg3+ Kf6
31.Be4 Rf7
A picturesque position. Black’s pieces are all tied up, but White cannot reap anything tangible from that, since he is bereft of pawns precisely where he needs them, on the f- and g-files.
32.Rc3 Kg7
33.Bg2 ...
The two bishops should be treasured, but never hoarded. After 33.Bxf5! gxf5 34.Rc6, I don’t see how Black will find a decent defense for the weak pawns at a7, d6 and f5; for example: 34...Rd8 35.Rxd6 Rxd6 36.Bxe5+, or 34...Rd7 35.Rxf5; and on 34...Rf6 35.Ra6 or 35.Rc7+ is sufficient. Trading off a pair of rooks with 33...Rxf5 34.Rxf5 gxf5 is also bad for Black, if for no other reason than 35.Bxa7.
33...Kf8
34.b4 Rb8
35.a3 Rb5
36.Rd1 Re7
37.Re3 Kf7

Szabo again disdains the win of a pawn, by 39.Bxe5 dxe5 40.Rxe5, and if 40...a5 41.Bf1 would be the simplest means of nipping all possible complications in the bud. But he does come back to this idea, all the same, a few moves later.
39...Nd3
40.Rf1 Ne5
41.Rc1 Nd3
42.Rc8 Ne5

Here I would no longer want the pawn: 43.Bf1 Rbb7 44.Rec3 looks more convincing.

White apparently forgot such a possibility existed. Now the white king must retreat to the first rank, which practically nullifies his material advantage.

5.Nc3 d6
6.Bc4 ...
White gives notice of his intent to break down the impregnable “Sicilian” center by means of a direct attack, which is one of the strategic ideas behind the move 6.Bc4. One must also keep the human factor in mind: Averbakh is hot for revenge on Taimanov for their game from the first half.
6...e6
7.0-0 a6
8.Be3 Qc7
9.Bb3 ...
White is spending two moves developing a bishop that Black can easily exchange with ...Nb8-c6-a5xb3, but there is a point to this. The exchanging operation also consumes a great deal of time, leaving White a strong knight at d4, while Black’s bishops will not exert much influence for the moment.

This is not Taimanov’s first experience with this opening: he played all of this against Lipnitsky in the XX USSR Championship in 1952. There White continued 12.e5 and achieved nothing.
12.e5! ...
The exclamation mark is not for the quality of the move, but for Averbakh’s courage. In his comments to the Lipnitsky game, Taimanov pointed out the best defensive method for Black, and wrote that White could safely consign the entire variation to the dustbin. Averbakh wants to find a better use for it.

15...Qxe5
Just what Averbakh was waiting for! It was later established that the correct line is 15...Nxb3 16.Nxb3 Qxe5 17.Na5, and here neither 17...Bd5 nor 17...Nf6 is any good, but 17...b4! leads to a highly interesting fight after 18.Nc4 Qc7! 19.Qxh5 0-0 20.Nb6 bxc3 21.Nxa8 Bxa8.
16.Bxe6! fxe6
Sometimes this type of pretty sacrifice can be refuted simply by castling. Here, however, 16...0-0 runs into 17.Rf5 Nf4 18.Rxe5 Nxh3+ and the bishop recaptures at h3 (19.Bxh3).

148. Najdorf—Averbakh
(Queen’s Indian Defense)
Middlegame and endgame cannot be separated, one from the other; in the middlegame — and sometimes even in the opening — the master discerns the outlines of the forthcoming endgame. Many of Averbakh’s creations are very logical and consistent because he is such a great authority on, and enthusiast of, the endgame. Here, by moves 12-15 he had already visualized the coming knight vs. bishop endgame, and did everything possible thereafter to assure his knight the best possible working conditions for its struggle against the bishop. We know the knight is strong: a) when the pawns are fixed, b) when it has points of support, and c) when the enemy pawns are on squares of the same color as his bishop.
Averbakh achieves all of this by means of some fine maneuvers, leaving Najdorf in complete Zugzwang.

8.Qc2 Nxc3
9.bxc3 ...
It has been said that this move weakened the c4-pawn, and that therefore the usual 9.Qxc3 was better. I do not think that such a weakening would have had very much of an effect on the overall pawn mass, had White only taken the status of this pawn (at c4) into account when making his further plans, and not allowed Black to attack it unimpeded. Black’s knight will now try to get to a5 via c6, which White should endeavor to meet by the timely posting of his knight to b3. Play could proceed approximately as follows: 9...Nc6 10.Nd2 Na5 11.Bxb7 Nxb7 12.Nb3. White now plans an immediate advance of his a-pawn to a4 and a5, thus forcing Black to play ...a7-a5 himself, which deprives his knight of that square. Should the knight then try for d6, it would be met by the very pawn it was trying to attack, advancing from c4 to c5.
9...Nc6
10.Ne5 Na5
11.Bxb7 Nxb7

Of course, this position is far less appealing for White than the one obtained in the preceding variation. The role of pawn-keeper is hardly a becoming one for the queen, and queens may also be exchanged.

19.Nb4 a6
20.cxb6 cxb6
21.Bd2 ...
White has an unenviable position — but why?
1) Above all, because his a2-and c3-pawns are clearly weaker than their opposite numbers at a6 and b6; the c-pawn especially needs constant defense;
2) White’s position contains a gaping hole at c4, which Black will find perfectly fitted to his knight, and perhaps to his rook as well;
3) the darksquare bishop is passively placed — compare it with Black’s!
White’s only chance is an attack on the weak pawn at b6, but this is illusory, since it can always advance to b5, and the knight on c4 protects it anyway.
Of course, Black cannot hold on to all the advantages his position contains, but he doesn’t need them all in order to win. Shortly White eliminates his weakness at c3, but only by entering precisely the sort of endgame Averbakh has been striving for. A more solid position would be obtained by 21.Nd3 Nc4 22.Rfc1 Rc6 23.Kf1.
21...Nc4
22.Be1 Bxb4

White is in absolute zugzwang. If 36.f4 Nd2 and 37...Ne4; if 36.e4 fxe4 followed by 37...Nd2 and 38...Nxe4; the king cannot move (36.Kg1), because of 36...Nd2 and 37...Nxf3; and if the rook goes to d3 (36.Rd3), then 36...Rb2 and 37...Rxb4. The move White actually plays allows Black to pick off an important center pawn for nothing, which ends the game for all practical purposes.

149. Taimanov—Szabo
(Dutch Defense)
1.d4 e6

3.Nc3 Nf6
4.e3 d5
5.Bd3 c6
6.f4 Be7
7.Nf3 0-0
8.0-0 ...
An unusual and rarely-seen system, the so-called Double Stonewall”, which once enjoyed great popularity. The blocked state of the center pawns enforces a complex maneuvering game, which gains a measure of sharpness from the positions of the knights at e4 and e5 and the possibility (never actually carried out in this game) of a sudden g2-g4 or ...g7-g5. The position is not wholly symmetrical: White’s pawn at c4 gives him some queenside initiative, so Black usually builds on the kingside. Both sides have “bad” queen’s bishops, and would be happy to trade them off, even if “only” for knights, or gradually bring them into play on the kingside. These basic motifs underlie the play for the next 8-10 moves.
8...b6
9.Bd2 Ba6
This move would have had some point, if Black could have traded off the lightsquare bishops, but it quickly becomes clear that he cannot exchange on c4 without giving up the center.
10.Qe2 ...
Since 10...Bxc4 11.Bxc4 dxc4 12.Qxc4 would leave serious weaknesses at e6 and c6, the bishop goes right back to b7.
10...Bb7
11.cxd5 ...
In many such positions it suits White to trade on d5 when Black cannot recapture with the e-pawn. Such a moment occurs now, and Taimanov seizes the c-file.
11...cxd5
12.Rfc1 ...
12.Rac1 was more accurate.
12...a6
13.Na4 Ne4
14.Ne5 Bd6
15.b4 Bxe5
This trade is more or less forced, as otherwise it would be difficult for Black to complete the development of his queenside. On 15...Nd7 there could follow 16.Nc6 Bxc6 17.Rxc6, hitting the bishop at d6 and threatening the a-pawn, as well as 18.Rac1, sealing his control of the open file.
16.fxe5 Bc6
17.Nb2 ...
Not a proper place for the knight. It should have returned to c3, and traded off the knight on e4 at the earliest convenient moment.
17...Be8
18.Rc2 Nd7
Szabo wishes to free himself from the coils of the positional squeeze that now menaces him. If 19.Bxa6, then 19...Qg5 threatens 20...Bh5 or 20...Nxd2; also, when the bishop leaves a6, Black’s rook will be able to invade at a3. So Taimanov declines the pawn.
19.a4 Qg5
20.Rf1 ...
So the rook ought not to have left here at move 12. In any event, Taimanov is now even with his opponent in time lost (9...Ba6 and 10...Bb7).
20...b5
Szabo cleverly continues his search for the initiative, once more offering a pawn: 21.axb5 axb5 22.Bxb5 Ra3!, with good chances; for example: 23.Bd3 Bh5 24.Qe1 Rfa8.
Thus, a not overly prolonged maneuvering stage is followed by a period during which combinative motifs appear more and more frequently.
21.a5 Bh5
22.Qe1 Rfd8
23.Rc6 Nf8
24.Bb1 Rdc8
25.Rxc8 Rxc8
26.Nd3 Nd7
Black’s active play has reaped some not inconsiderable positional fruits: his “inferior” light-square bishop is better developed than the enemy’s passive darksquare bishop, he has wrested control of the c-file away, and the threatened Nc5 is not dangerous due to 27.Nc5 Nexc5 28.bxc5 Qe7, followed by ...Nd7-b8-c6.
27.Nf4 Bf7
28.Bxe4 fxe4

30.Rc1 Qf5
31.Ne2 Bg6
32.Rf1 Qg5
33.Nf4 Bf5
34.Be1 Nb8
35.Qb2 Nc6
Black has completed his regrouping and now stands better: he attacks the b-pawn, and controls the c-file, and his queen is active too. All that saves White is the fact that the bishop is somewhat insecure at f5, since White’s next move sets up a threat of 37.Nxd5 followed by 38.Qxf5.
36.Qf2 ...
Now White wins a pawn by the threat of 37.Nxe6, but remains with the inferior position. When the gunfire dies down a bit, we shall explain why this is so.
36...h6
37.Nxd5 exd5
38.Qxf5 Qxe3+
39.Bf2 Qg5
40.Qe6+ Kh7
41.Qxd5 ...
41...Qg6
Black refrains from advancing his e-pawn for the moment, so as not to give White’s queen access to the kingside.
Now he threatens ...Nxb4, ...Rc2, and ...e4-e3, in this or some other order. The strength of Black’s position is that his pieces stand ready to attack the king, and his pawn at e4 is worth a piece. White’s pawn, by contrast, can only advance: it supports nothing, and needs protection itself as well.
These are all general ideas, however; the actual play hereabouts requires great accuracy and farseeing calculation. The next few moves by both sides are the best possible — from the viewpoint of the respective opponents — since the game was adjourned at this point, and resumed after painstaking analysis.
42.e6 Nxb4
43.Qd6 ...
This is stronger than 43.Qd7, when there would follow 43...e3, and if 44.Bxe3 Qe4, or if 44.Bg3 e2 45.Re1 Qg4. In both these lines Black wins, as has been demonstrated by detailed analysis, whose variations run to the 53rd move; we shall present only one of them: 44.Bg3 e2 45.Re1 Qg4 46.Qf7 Qxd4+ 47.Kh1 Qd5 48.Rxe2 Rc2 49.Qf1 Qd3 50.Re1 Qxf1+ 51.Rxf1 Re2 52.Re1 Rxe1+ 53.Bxe1 Nd5, and wins.
43...Nd3
44.h3 Rc2
45.Bg3 e3
46.e7 Qe4
47.Rf3 e2
48.Qd7 ...
After analyzing the adjourned position, Taimanov ought to have realized the seriousness of Black’s counterchances and made some attempt at reaching a peaceable conclusion. Now was precisely the right time: 48.e8=Q! Qxe8 49.Rxd3 e1=Q+ 50.Bxe1 Qxe1+ 51.Kh2 is a forced draw. The text move not only fails to improve White’s winning chances, but might actually have lost.
48...e1=Q+
At the last moment, Szabo’s nerves failed him—he may have been short of time — and he too failed to see the pretty and thematic 48...Nf4, when even two queens would not be enough to save White from mate. For example: 49.e8=Q e1=Q+ 50.Bxe1 Rxg2+ 51.Kh1 Qxf3 or 49.Be1 Rc1 50.e8=Q Rxe1+ 51.Kh2 Rh1+ 52.Kxh1 e1=Q+ 53.Kh2 Qxe8, or 49.Qf5+ Qxf5 50.e8=Q e1=Q+ 51.Bxe1 Rxg2+ 52.Kf1 Rh2 53.Qe5 Qc2.
49.Bxe1 Rxg2+
50.Kxg2 Nxe1+
51.Kf2
DRAW
— it’s perpetual check. A pretty game, and a complex one.
150. Gligoric—Euwe
(Nimzoindian Defense)
“The basic position of the Nimzo-Indian” (after 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3 c5 5.Bd3 d5 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.0-0 0-0) occurred eleven times in this tournament prior to this twenty-second round; of those games, six were drawn, with the results of the remaining five favoring Black slightly.
You will not find Gligoric’s name listed among those who are considered “main-line enthusiasts”; those would be Reshevsky, Euwe and Averbakh. For this game Gligoric came as close to the main line as he ever did in the course of the tournament, but he gave it a different treatment, more like a Queen’s Gambit: developing the bishop at e2, he traded off the center pawns so as to leave Black an isolated d5-pawn. The game’s chief interest lies in the ebb and flow of the positional struggle that revolves around this pawn.
Heavy-piece fighting for an isolated pawn is one of the central elements of positional play. Much more is involved than the simple formula: “White attacks twice, Black defends twice—and a draw is the outcome”. Woven into the struggle are such motifs as: pinning the isolated pawn (should the heavy pieces defend it from behind), a sudden switch to an attack on the king, or an attempt to occupy the seventh rank at some point when the heavy pieces are tied to the defense of the isolated pawn. Isolated pawn endings were played with great skill by the classicists Lasker, Capablanca and Rubinstein. In the present game, Gligoric and Euwe come forearmed with their knowledge of the old masters’ legacy. The reader who immerses himself in this battle’s fine points, who examines the techniques used here, and who familiarizes himself with the basic ideas behind this type of ending, will have made a great stride forward in positional play.
The game’s concluding phase, a “four-vs-three” rook endgame, is also of great theoretical interest.
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6

10.a3 ...
It is Black’s task to rid himself of the isolated pawn— that is, to push it to d4 and trade it off. This, however, is impossible for the moment, due to 11.Na4. The natural thing for Black to do would therefore be to prepare this advance with ...a7-a6 and ...Ba7. It is White’s task to use these two tempi to bring out another piece to control the d4 square, intending to occupy it later on with a knight. Following this plan, one must consider 10.b3! a6 11.Na4 Ba7 12.Bb2 more logical; if then 12...b5 13.Rc1!, followed by 14.Nc5. The square d4 would have remained under White’s control, a strategic accomplishment of no small importance.
10...a6
11.b4 Bd6
In his detailed comments to this game for a Yugoslav magazine, Gligoric’s second, Trifunovic, indicates that 11...Ba7 should have been played here: on 12.Bb2, Black could have continued 12...d4; and on 12.b5 (after 11...Ba7), Trifunovic gives a pretty variation: 12...d4 13.bxc6 dxc3 14.Qb3 Qc7 15.Qxc3 Bd7 16.Ne5 Nd5. Here too, however, White could continue 17.Qb2 Bxc6 18.Nxc6 Qxc6 19.Bf3, and hold a definite plus, thanks to his bishop pair, open files and extra center pawn.
12.Bb2 Bg4
13.Rc1 Bc7
14.Na4 ...
Gligoric has completed the first part of his plan: the d-pawn is now fixed firmly in place. Euwe hopes to stir up some play on the kingside, but White easily repels Black’s threats, and by steadily trading off minor pieces, draws closer and closer to his goal: a battle of heavy pieces for the isolated pawn.
14...Qd6
15.g3 Ne4
16.Nc5 ...
The centralized knight must go first. 16.Nd4 would have been inferior, owing to 16...Bh3 17.Re1 Qf6.
16...Nxc5
17.Rxc5 Rad8
18.Nd4 ...
Now White has a solid grip on the d4 square, and Black’s attack can no longer come to anything, in view of the small amount of material left on the board.
18...Bxe2
19.Qxe2 Nxd4
20.Bxd4 Bb6
21.Rd1! ...
This move is the tactical justification for White’s whole plan. If the rook were forced to retreat from c5 here, the exchange of bishops would leave White with an isolated pawn as well, and there would be no further reason why he should think about winning.
21...Bxc5
22.Bxc5 Qe5
23.Bxf8 Kxf8
24.Rd4 g6
25.b5
In order to understand what follows, one must keep in mind that rook endings with four pawns to three, all on one side, generally cannot be won. So if all of the queenside pawns disappear, Black would be risking very little even if he does lose the isolated d-pawn. With this in mind, 25.b5, which leads to exchanges, is not a very good move: 25.Qd2 would be more consistent, threatening 26.e4 and forcing 25...f5.
Attacking the isolated pawn on the file with the threat of e3-e4 is a technique common to such endings.
25...axb5
26.Qxb5 Qc7
27.Qb2 Kg8
28.Qd2 Qc5
Euwe defends excellently. Here, 29.e4 was threatened, and if 28...Ra8 29.Rxd5 Rxa3, White would have continued 30.Rd8+ Kg7 31.Qd4+ Kh6 32.Rg8. By inducing the further advance of the a-pawn, Black increases the likelihood of its exchange, and hopes thereby to turn the game into a drawn ending.
29.a4 Qa3
30.a5 Rc8
The pawn can no longer be defended; by giving it up now, Black hopes to get the queens traded off, at least.
31.Rxd5 ...
Here, Gligoric, who has managed the game very consistently and powerfully up to now, commits a small inaccuracy, but a very common one. Having forced Black to abandon the d-pawn’s defense, he ought not to have taken it just yet, as this gives Euwe the chance to bring his rook to a good position. 31.Kg2 was correct; if then 31...Qc1, he should avoid trading queens for the moment by playing his queen to b4. Here it is important that the variation 31...Qc1 32.Qb4 Rc2 33.Rxd5 Qxe3 does not work for Black, in view of 34.Rd8+, 35.Qf8+ and 36.Rd6+.
31...Qc1+
32.Qxc1 Rxc1+
33.Kg2 Rb1
With this rook maneuver, Black ensures the exchange of his last queenside pawn. It is elementary, but important, that White can accomplish nothing by attacking the pawn from behind: 34.Rd8+ Kg7 35.Rb8 Rb5, and White cannot play 36.a6.
And so, in a few moves we shall see the theoretically drawn f our vs. three-pawn rook endgame. Gligoric wants to test theory’s conclusion, to see how much truth there is in it; so he plays on for a while, risking nothing. For the moment, he simply places his pawns more actively.
34.g4 Kg7
35.h4 b6
36.h5 bxa5
37.Rxa5 Rb7
38.g5 ...
Opinions vary on this move. Euwe gave it an exclamation mark, calling it “a pawn sacrifice rich with possibilities”, while Trifunovic considered it a serious mistake, allowing Black to trade off two pawns. He recommended postponing g4-g5 in favor of the preparatory moves Kg3, f3, e4, Kf4 and Ra6. I submit that neither of them is completely correct: Black need not lose here, regardless of whether or not White plays g4-g5.
The move g4-g5 is interesting from a psychological standpoint. It was played just before the time-control, leaving Euwe to decide whether to reply 38...gxh5, which weakens his pawn formation — “but who would have imagined that this would play such an important role in the resulting — three vs. three! — endgame? (Euwe). Instead, he could have played 38...h6, which would have led to a much clearer draw after the exchange of two pawns.
38...gxh5
39.Ra6 ...
Beautifully played! Now ...h7-h6 will be impossible, of course, but White is also threatening to bring up his pawn to e4, his king to f5, and his rook to h.6. White wins this ending, if he can capture the h5-pawn while keeping the pawns at f7 and h7 in place.
39...Rb3
Either Euwe had no time left to think, or else he considered he could draw as he pleased; in any case, he was not paying sufficient attention to his opponent’s plan. The rook had to be brought to e6, when it turns out that exchanging rooks results in a king and pawn endgame that Black can just barely draw: 39...Re7 40.Kg3 Re6 41.Rxe6 fxe6 42.Kh4 Kg6 43.f4 h6. If White does not take on e6, then Black plays ...h7-h6; and if White answers 39...Re7 with 40.Rh6, then 40...Re5 41.Rxh5 Kg6. Curiously, the rook can only be transferred to e6 via e7: Euwe’s recommendation 39...Rb4 40.f4 Re4 41.Kf3 Re6, etc., is refuted by 40.f3, by which White covers both g4 and e4, keeping Black’s rook off the sixth rank and threatening 41.Rh6.
40.Rh6 Ra3
41.Kg3 Ra1
Black meets the threatened 42.Rxh5 by threatening to reply with 42...Kg6.
42.e4 Rg1+
43.Kf4 Rh1
44.e5 h4
Euwe might have adjourned the game on move 40, but continued playing until the 44th move, during which time he succeeded in committing his final mistake. Advancing this pawn gave White’s king the square g4 and shortened .the range of his own rook enough to give White sufficient basis for a real winning attempt. With the black pawn at h5, I do not believe a win would have been possible. If, for instance, White sets up this position: Kf5, Rb7, and pawns at f4, e5 and g5, with the threat of e5-e6, then Black puts his rook on the e-file, which renders the pawn advance unplayable, and White’s king has no move either.
45.Kg4 Rg1+
46.Kf5 ...
White does not fall into the trap 46.Kxh4 Rh1+, when Black draws the pawn endgame after 47.Kg4 Rxh6 48.gxh6+ Kxh6 49.Kf5 Kg7 50.f3 h6 51.f4 h5 52.Kg5 f6+ 53.exf6+ Kf7, etc.
46...Rh1
47.Kg4 Rg1+
48.Kf5 Rh1
From now on, this position will be included in every endgame textbook. The winning method, discovered by Gligoric in actual play, is not only pretty and logically consistent, but a valuable addition to theory as well.
Reaching the final position will require White to advance his pawn from e5 to e6 with his rook on the seventh rank, but this is not immediately playable. Gligoric’s plan to make it so may be divided into the following stages:
1) induce the black h-pawn to advance, and then capture it;
2) bring his own rook to d1 and drive the enemy rook from the e-file;
3) carry out the final maneuver by pushing the f-pawn to f5 and the e-pawn to e6 with the support of the king and rook.
49.f4 h3
It was noted in the first edition of this book that Black advanced this pawn to h3 in view of the threat of 50.Kg4, since the white king could now capture the h-pawn while his f-pawn is on f4: 49...-- 50.Kg4 Rg1+ 51.Kxh4 Rh1+ 52.Kg4 Rxh6 53.gxh6+ Kxh6 54.f5, when the pawn ending is won for White.
But as Orlov, an amateur from Leningrad, has pointed out, this is not so: the ending is a draw! Black continues 54...Kg7 55.Kg5 f6+ 56.exf6+ Kf7. He also notes that the text move (49...h3) is necessary, but for a different reason: 50.Kg4 Rg1+ 51.Kh3! Rh1+ 52.Kg2, which wins the pawn.
50.Kg4 Rg1+
51.Kf3 Rf1+
52.Kg3 Rg1+
53.Kf2 Rh1
54.Rf6 ...
A pretty move, which aims by the use of zugzwang either to force the king to retreat or to force the rook to move, after which the white king can attack and capture the h-pawn. white’s rook had to go to f6 in order to defend the f-pawn.
An interesting line is 54...Kg8 55.Kg3 Kg7 56.Kg4 Kg8 57.Rh6, and the pawn falls, since if the rooks are exchanged by 57...Rg1+ 58.Kxh3 Rh1+ 59.Kg4 Rxh6 60.gxh6, the black king can no longer reach the pawn at h6.
54...Ra1
55.Kg3 Rh1
56.Kg4 Kg8
57.Rh6 ...
Now White is threatening to take the pawn with his rook; if 57...Rg1+, then 58.Kxh3 is also possible, with the same ideas mentioned in the preceding note.
57...h2
In Orlov’s opinion, this was the decisive mistake by Black, who let the draw slip here. This could have been obtained, he says, by 57...Rg1+ 58.Kxh3 Rh1+ 59.Kg4 Rxh6 60.gxh6 f6 61.exf6 Kf7 62.Kf5 Kf8 63.Ke6 Ke8 64.f7+ Kf8.
I was just preparing myself to argue with this capable Leningrad analyst, when my thunder was stolen by the well-known expert on pawn endgames, Igor Maizelis, who pointed out that in exactly the position where Orlov ends his analysis in the belief that it is an obvious draw White can win with a maneuver reminiscent of a composed study: 65.Kd6!! Kxf7 66.Kd7 Kf8 67.Ke6, etc. And if Black plays 62...Ke8 in Orlov’s line (instead of 62...Kf8), then 63.Ke6 Kf8 64.Kd7 Kf7 65.Kd8 Kf8 66.f7 Kxf7 67.Kd7 Kf6 68.Ke8, and the white king attacks and captures the last black pawn, and then shepherds its own pawn through to h8.
Additionally, Master Fridstein has pointed out that, in Orlov’s line with 57...Rg1+ instead of 57...h2, White is not obliged to take on the pawn ending, but can capture the pawn by a different route: 58.Kf3 Rf1+ 59.Kg3 Rg1+ 60.Kf2 Rh1 61.Rh4. All that remains is for me to thank Messrs. Orlov, Maizelis and Fridstein for their interesting and valuable comments.
58.Kg3 Rg1+
59.Kxh2 Rg4
White has now completed the first part of his plan, but the win is not easy even yet: his king is cut off, and the f-pawn needs protection.
As a matter of fact, couldn’t Black cut off the white king on the h-file permanently? No, because after 60.Rf6 Kg7 61.Kh3 Rg1 62.Ra6 the threat to advance the e-pawn (with the king at h5 and the rook at a7) would force Black’s rook off the g-file.
60.Rf6 Kg7
61.Kh3 Rg1
62.Kh4 Rh1+
63.Kg4 Rg1+
64.Kf5 Rf1
Black has selected the defensive plan of tying White’s king to the f-pawn. By attacking the f-pawn from behind, Black leaves his king relatively free to maneuver (...Kg7-f8-g7), while also preventing the white king from occupying f6; with White’s rook on the seventh rank, this would decide the game at once. When White’s king comes out, Black’s rook will check on the files, but Gligoric finds a skillful maneuver to drive Black’s rook from the f-file and secure the win.
As Euwe points out, 64...Ra1, Black’s other possible plan here, would not have saved him either: 65.Rc6 Ra4 66.Rc7 Kf8 67.Kg4 Ra1 68.f5, and now comes a series of checks, which the king escapes on c8: 68...Rg1+ 69.Kf4 Rf1+ 70.Ke4 Re1+ 71.Kd5 Rd1+ 72.Kc6 Rc1+ 73.Kd7 Rd1+ 74.Kc8 Rd5 75.f6 Rxe5 76.Kd7, and by forcing the trade of rooks White reaches a won pawn ending: 76...Rd5+ 77.Kc6 Rd8 78.Rd7. And if 74...Rg1, then 75.f6 Rxg5 76.Kd7, etc.
65.Rc6 Kf8
Had Black not played 64...Rf1, then the simple 66.Kf6 would have decided here. If 66.Rc4 to prepare this, then naturally the black king returns to g7 (66...Kg7).
66.Rc8+ Kg7
67.Rd8 ...
Zugzwang again. What can Black do?
I. 67...h6 68.gxh6+ Kxh6 69.Rg8. With Black’s king cut off, White wins easily.
II. 67...Ra1 68.Rd7, threatening 69.e6, and Black is lost, considering:
a) 68...Ra5 69.Kg4 Kf8 70.Rd8+ Kg7 71.f5 Rxe5 72.f6+, with mate next;
b) 68...Kf8 69.Kf6 Ra6+ 70.Rd6!, etc. ;
c) 68...Ra6 69.Kg4 h6 70.f5 Kg8 71.Rd8+ Kh7 72.g6+ fxg6 73.f6.
All that’s left is the text.
67...Rf2
But after White’s reply,
68.Rd1 ...
Black has no more checks, nor can his rook return to f1.
Thus, White has now completed the second part of his plan, and is all ready to push his pawns to f5 and e6, once the black rook has been forced off the f-file. If the rook does not leave the file, then the king must go either to g8 or to f8, which would leave it perilously placed indeed after White’s f4-f5-f6; for example: 68...Kf8 69.Kg4 Re2 70.Kf3 Ra2 71.f5.
68...Rf3
69.Ke4 Rf2
70.Ke3 Ra2
71.f5! ...
The concluding phase: White’s pawns are set in motion.
71...Rg2
71...Ra7 would be met by 72.Ke4, 73.Rd8, and e5-e6 or f5-f6+.
72.Rd7
By now White had another way to win: 72.g6 hxg6 73.f6+.
72...Rxg5
White would have won beautifully after 72...Kf8: 73.f6 Ke8 74.Re7+ Kf8 75.Rb7 Ke8 76.Rb8+ Kd7 77.Rf8 Ke6 78.Re8+ Kf5 79.e6!
73.Kf4 Rg1
74.e6 Rf1+
75.Ke5 Re1+
76.Kd6 h5
77.Rxf7+ Kg8
78.Ke7
BLACK RESIGNED
78...h4 is met by 79.Kf6 h3 80.Rg7+ Kh8 81.Rg3.
An endgame that will repay close study.

In my preparations for the Stahlberg game, I set great store by this flank attack, which seemed to refute Black’s plan of bringing a knight to e6. On 10...g6, 11.Bxf6 Bxf6 12.h5 is very strong, and on 10...h6 I intended to continue 11.Bxf6 Bxf6 12.g4, followed by queenside castling and g4-g5; I felt such an attack would have to succeed. But Stahlberg played
10...h6
anyway, and immediately I saw my mistake.
11.Bxf6 Bxf6
12.0-0-0 ...
Unfortunately, after 12.g4 Nc7! White is short the one tempo he needs in order to continue with his pawn storm. He should still have played 12.g4, however, but with the idea, after 12...Nc7, of laying aside temporarily his ideas of a crushing attack, in favor of a plan to accumulate positional advantages, beginning with 13.Bf5. White’s irrepressible urge to complicate soon forces him back on the defensive.
12...Nc7
13.h5 Bg4
14.Kb1 0-0
The decision of a great master. Not everyone would dare to castle when his opponent had already pushed his pawn to h5, but Stahlberg has accurately calculated that the c-file will be opened before a white pawn can get even as far as g5.
15.Ne2 Nb5
16.Ne5 Bxe5
17.dxe5 Qb6
17...a6 was more logical: then 18.Bxb5 axb5 would open the a-file, which would cause White a lot of worry in connection with a possible pawn storm.
18.Bxb5 Qxb5
19.f3 Bf5
20.Qxf5 Qxe2
21.Rhe1 ...
Offering Black’s queen a choice: either leave the area, and thereby allow White’s g-pawn to proceed with a boarding expedition, or remain in the area of the upcoming skirmishes.
21...Qf2
Black’s decision turned on his assessment of the line 22.Qg4 f5 23.exf6 Rxf6 24.f4, when the queen appears about to be trapped, but Black escapes damage by exploiting a pin: 24...Re8 25.Re2 Rxf4.
22.Qg4 ...
The same initial move as in the variation presented above, but with the more modest goal of creating a passed e-pawn. His trust in the almighty powers of this pawn nearly ends up costing White the game, but finally it saves him as well. Another possible plan, 22.g4, would have resulted in a sharp game; however, White’s attacking fires had been damped by move twenty.
22...f5
23.Qh3 Rad8
24.f4 d4
Returning the queen to active duty.
25.exd4 Qxf4
26.Qb3+ Rf7
27.d5 cxd5
28.e6 ...
The remainder of the game may almost be said to follow from this advance. If the rook simply recaptures at d5 (28.Rxd5), 28...Rxd5 29.Qxd5 Qh4 would force White’s rook to abandon the e-file; thus, 28.e6, which clears e5 for the white queen. All very properly thought out, except that White completely forgot about his h-pawn, which could have been saved by 31.Qd1.
28...Re7
29.Rxd5 Rxd5
30.Qxd5 Qh4
31.Qe5 Qxh5
32.Qb8+ Kh7
33.Qd6 ...
Not 33.Qf8 Rxe6!
33...Qg5
34.gxg3 Qf6
35.a3 h5
36.Ka2 g5
37.Qd5 Kg6
38.Qd8 ...
White has no sense of the danger — such is the power of his faith in the amulet on e6. While the white queen dances back and forth, Black is making a passed pawn of his own; thereafter, White’s affairs take a sharp turn for the worse. Of course, the pawn at e6 does constrict Black’s forces powerfully, but White’s pieces are tied to it as well. The only real advantage it confers on White is the greater mobility of his rook. Therefore, before Black finds time to regroup, the king should be sent out to save the pawn, especially now that the road that leads to it (a2-b3-c4-d5), although completely open, is also completely safe. But a king-march to the middle of the board with queens and rooks still on the board is nothing to be lightly undertaken; White — mistakenly — hesitates to make the decision.
38...Kg7
39.Qd6 Kg6
40.Qd8 Kh6
Unlike its white counterpart, the black king may even be a bit too active. In the heat of the time-scramble, Black cannot decide on the proper way to open up his fortress.
41.Qd5 f4
Now Black’s two pawns far outweigh White’s singleton.
42.gxf4 Qxf4
43.Re5 Qf6
44.Qe4 b5!
Preventing 45.a4, which would have bolstered white’s position a little, and setting up a threat to exchange queens at c4. So now White must push his pawn anyway, but that gives Black two pawns plus.
45.Qe2 a6
46.a4 bxa4
47.Qe3 h4
On 47...Qf4, White would have attacked the rook with 48.Qc5. Had White not taken the b-pawn away from its protection of the c4 square (46...-- 47.Qe3), then 47...Qf4 48.Qc5 Qc4+ would have won easily here.
48.Re4 Kg6
49.Qe2 h3
50.Re3 ...
Retreat all along the line. Now White has troubles with Black’s g- and h-pawns to add to his worries over the e-pawn.
50...Kg7
51.Qh2 Rb7
52.Qe2 Re7
53.Qh2 a3
White’s defensive resources are running out, and Black, with two pawns plus, decides to return one, since 54.bxa3 would completely denude the white king, and capturing with the king is also not without its dangers, in view of possible checks along the diagonal a3-f8 or from the squares a5 or a4. However, the white king has no choice now, so this time he throws himself into the river without a second thought. A move earlier, Black could have placed White in zugzwang with 52...Kf8! (53.Rf3 Rxb2+!), but such moves frequently escape notice in the course of a game.
54.Kxa3 Rxe6
55.Qc7+ Qf7
56.Qc3+ ...
This maneuver, which Black may have underestimated, saves White’s game. With the black king exposed, the advantage of the g-pawn cannot be turned to account.
56...Rf6
57.Rxh3 Qe7+
58.Ka2 Qe6+
59.Ka1 Kg8
60.Rh1 Qc6
61.Qh3 ...
White’s queen and rook are free to roam once more, so Black decides that it’s time to settle the issue peaceably by perpetual check.
61...Qa4+
62.Kb1 Qe4+
63.Ka1
DRAW
152. Reshevsky—Boleslavsky
(King’s Indian)
Chess is a limitless game; to avoid losing his way in it, the chessplayer will use certain guideposts to orient himself in the evaluation of a position and the selection of a plan, such as weak pawns, open files, a lead in development, good and bad bishops, a poorly placed king, and so on. It is worth noting that one will not find in every game such guideposts as will allow one to compare a position’s good and bad points and to choose a proper plan on that basis. Either chess theory has not yet found a quantity of guideposts sufficient to exhaust the game’s diversity, or else there are positions in which the balance has been upset more than once, and guideposts are hard to discern. In any event, one frequently finds the sort of game which must be played for quite some time on nothing more than gut feeling and calculation, and this is the hardest sort of game to play, even for a grandmaster.
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 g6
3.g3 Bg7
4.Bg2 0-0
5.Nc3 d6
6.Nf3 c5
7.d5 Na6
This move is, of course, not classical. Apiece is developed somewhere out on the rim, immediately makes another move, and winds up at c7, which has never been considered a very good square for a knight. However, ideas such as this occur frequently in the modern type of game, where they are dangerous. precisely because of their seeming illogic and, at the same time, their preeminent practicality.
The whole point to the maneuver ...Nb8-a6-c7 and ...Ra8-b8 is that Black wants to play ...b7-b5 without recourse to ...a7-a6. Why play ...b7-b5, when White can reply simply b2-b3? Not so fast: in order to play b2-b3, White must first remove two of his pieces from the long diagonal; after that, however, Black can trade pawns on c4, followed by bishop to a6 and rook to b4, when White will have a very difficult time defending his c-pawn. It is for that reason — to keep a6 clear for the bishop — that Black does not wish to play ...a7-a6.
8.0-0 Nc7
9.Nd2 Rb8
10.a4 e6
Now Black attacks the c4-pawn from the other side. Playing e2-e4 would block the diagonal of White’s own bishop, so he takes on e6; after
11.dxe6 Bxe6
he has the choice of either leaving his knight tied to the defense of his c-pawn, or
12.Nde4! ...
From here until approximately the 23rd move, the game follows a long and complicated course of tactical calculation, for which no all-inclusive general rules have yet been formulated. In the art of complex combinative calculation, these two are worthy foes — in fact, at the time this tournament was played they were, along with Geller and Taimanov, the best calculating players in the world. Naturally, this does not by any means lessen their stature as positional players.
Let’s examine a few of the combinative motifs that will occur during the creative process. Black’s rook, having left a8, now defends the b7-pawn, but the knight and the rook are now subject to diagonal attack. After the white queen’s bishop leaves c1, the b2-pawn will be left undefended, and the black king’s bishop will be able to capture it with tempo. After White’s knight captures the do-pawn, the squares e8 and c8 will be closed to Black’s rooks, and moving the bishop to e7 will win White the exchange; and so forth, and so on. This is far from being a complete listing, of course: merely fragmented glimpses of the sort of general ideas that take shape in the chessplayer’s mind as he makes his choice of possible continuations.
12...Nxe4
13.Nxe4 Bxc4
14.Bg5 Qd7
Boleslavsky is trying to entice his opponent inside the walls of the fortress, but Reshevsky stoutly resists the temptation: 15.Nf6+ Bxf6 16.Bxf6 Qe6 brings White no special rewards, while further losses will not be long in coming his way. If Black had played 14...f6, White could have replied 15.Bf4 g5 16.Nxd6.
15.Qxd6 Qxd6
16.Nxd6 Bxe2
17.Rfe1 Bd3
18.Be7 ...
The prospect of giving up a rook for the darksquare bishop and picking up a pair of pawns as interest, naturally, doesn’t disturb Black at all. But Reshevsky has spotted an important peculiarity of the forthcoming endgame: his rooks will be able to act in concert against Black’s bishop and two pawns. The only thing that gives him some slight pause is Black’s possession of two powerful bishops.
18...Bxb2
19.Ra2 Bg7
20.Bf1 ...
A pretty move to conclude this game’s combinative phase: Black’s assets will no longer include the pair of bishops. His rook can no more leave f8 than his queen’s bishop can avoid exchange. Now White can exploit his lead in development and the strong position of his rooks. On the other hand, Black’s position is by no means lost: it is his overassessment of his own chances that costs him the game later.
20...Bxf1
21.Kxf1 Nd5
A knight’s strength is doubled when it has pawn support. Had Boleslavsky played 21...Ne6, he would have obtained a solid position, with the knight cutting short all of White’s attempts to win the queenside pawns, moving to d4 also if necessary.
22.Bxf8 Bxf8
23.Rae2! ...
Beautiful play! White threatens to trade off Black’s rook and attack the pawns from behind. This combination would obviously have been impossible if the knight stood at e6, which is why it was so important to close the e-file with the knight. Now Black has to take the knight, since 23...Kg7 allows 24.Ne8+ and 25.Re5.
23...Bxd6
24.Rd2 Bf8
Had Black gone after the g-pawn, he would have lost to 24...Bxg3 25.hxg3 Nc7 26.Re7 Ne6 27.Rdd7. However, it’s difficult to believe that with two pawns for the exchange, Black could think of no more active move than 24...Bf8. He might have tried picking off a third pawn with 24...Nb6, for instance. On the other hand, if the author had been playing Black here, and had moved his knight to b6, and then lost, Boleslavsky might then have written in
his
notes that 24...Bf8 should have been tried — and he, in his turn, would have been right also.
25.Rxd5 c4
Black wants to push this pawn to c3 so it can be defended by the bishop. If 25...a6, Euwe recommends 26.Rde5 b5 27.a5, with the idea of winning the a-pawn. To my way of thinking, 26.a5 is a sounder line for White.
26.Re4 ...
Refuting Black’s idea. 26.Rc1 Rc8, followed by ...c3 and ...Bg7, would leave Black with no worries; but now 26...Rc8 would be met by 27.Rdd4 c3 28.Rc4, and after the rooks are exchanged, the pawn must fall: 28...Rxc4 29.Rxc4 Bg7? 30.Rc8+.
The same result follows 26...c3 27.Rc4 Bg7 28.Rdc5!, and after the unavoidable exchange of rooks, White wins easily by bringing his king to d3, after which his unchained rook begins to reap the defenseless black a- and b-pawns.
26...a6
Boleslavsky has one last chance: to trade off White’s a-pawn and advance his one remaining compensating pawn as far as possible.
27.Rxc4 b5
28.axb5 axb5
29.Rc7 b4
30.Rdd7 Ra8
The pawn cannot be pushed further just yet, in view of 30...b3? 31.Rb7.
31.Kg2 Ra2
32.Rxf7 b3
33.Rb7 Bc5
To understand the following curious events, one must know, first of all, that they occurred while Reshevsky was in tremendous time-trouble; and secondly, that all of this occurred very late at night. The twenty-second round fell on a Saturday. For religious reasons, Reshevsky started his Saturday games some hours after the usual time — after the rise of the evening star; on Fridays, he played his games during the day, so as to finish before the rise of that same star.
Fearing to leave something hanging in time-pressure, Reshevsky decides to play Rf7-f3-d3-d7-f7, which was playable with Black’s pawn at b3, but allowed Black a saving clause when the pawn went to b2.
34.Rf3 b2
35.Rd3 Bf8
Now the win could have been attained with 36.Rd8, but Reshevsky follows his “plan”.
36.Rdd7 ...
And here, Black might have saved his game with the clever rook retreat from a2 to a7. Boleslavsky still had a few minutes, and in the light of day he would no doubt have seen and played that move; but at 2:00 a.m., and after a tense and exhausting struggle, he played automatically:
36...Bc5?
and after
37.Rd8+ Bf8
38.Rdb8
BLACK RESIGNED
153. Keres—Kotov
(Catalan Opening)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6
3.g3 d5
4.Bg2 Be7
5.Nf3 0-0
6.0-0 c6
After this, Keres transposes into a classical Reti configuration in which Black has no particular need of the move ...c7-c6. Kotov could also have used another, perhaps more accurate, move order: 6...Nbd7, and if 7.b3 c5.
7.b3 Nbd7
8.Bb2 b6
9.Nbd2 Bb7
10.Rc1 Rc8
11.e3 c5
There exists a barely perceptible difference between White’s position and Black’s. How much is “barely”? White’s bishop is on g2, while Black’s is on e7. Keres asks himself, “How may this affect the further course of play?”, and answers, “The white queen has the square e2, while the symmetrical square e7 is occupied by Black’s bishop, and his queen will be uncomfortable on an open file.” Thus, White’s plan begins with the moves e3, Qe2 and Rfd1 — but this is only a beginning.
12.Qe2 cxd4
13.Nxd4 Nc5
14.Rfd1 Qd7
Black must clear d8 for his rook, and then quit the d-file. This costs him two moves, and his queen on e8 is still not so well posted as White’s on e2.
15.N2f3 Rfd8
16.Ne5 Qe8
17.cxd5 ...
Keres initiates a multi-branched combination of unusual complexity, based on pinning possibilities along the c-file, the activity of his fianchettoed king’s bishop, and in one variation even a threat of mate at g7!
17...Bxd5
18.Ndc6 ...
A brilliant move, completely unexpected. The knight is now triply attacked, and only the knight at e5 defends it! As it turns out, however, the c6 square is also controlled by the bishop at g2 “through” the bishop at d5, and by the rook at c1 “through” the knight at c5!
If 18...Bxc6 19.Rxd8 Bxd8 20.Nxc6 Rxc6 21.Bxc6 Qxc6 22.b4, the knight is pinned and White wins the exchange for a pawn. And if 18...Bxg2 19.Nxd8 Ba8 20.N8xf7.
18...Rxc6
19.Nxc6 Qxc6
On 19...Bxc6 we get the variation mentioned in the preceding note.
20.Bxd5 ...
White also wins the exchange for a pawn this way — a pedestrian return for a combination on such a grand scale. He would have gotten a good deal more out of 20.Bxf6 Bxf6 21.e4 Bxe4 22.Rxd8+ Bxd8 23.Bxe4 Qxe4 24.Qxe4 Nxe4 25.Rc8, or 20...Bxg2 21.Bxe7 Re8 22.Bxc5 Bf3 23.Bxb6, and White comes out two pawns ahead.
20...exd5
21.b4 Nfe4
22.bxc5 bxc5
23.Qg4 ...
23...g6
24.h4 Qe6
25.Qxe6 fxe6
White has the better position, but Black has excellent counter-chances. Now White must overcome Kotov’s unflagging resourcefulness all over again in order to win the game — no small order, considering the energy and imagination Keres expended on the preceding stage.
26.Be5 c4
27.Rc2 ...
27.Bd4 would have been better here, in order to keep the knight out of c5 and d3.
27...Nc5
28.Rb1 Kf7
29.Bd4 Rd7
30.Rcb2 ...
30...e5 had to be prevented, so 30.Kf1 was the move. However, one cannot see everything.
30...e5
Having succeeded in advancing this pawn by combinative means and bringing up his king, Kotov need no longer have any fears as to the outcome of this game.
31.Bxc5 Bxc5
32.Rc2 Rc7
33.e4 ...
Keres still tries for the win, but he may have missed the boat already. With this move, he prevents 33...d4, so he can return his rook to c1 and pick up the pawn at c4.
33...Ke6
34.Kf1 Bd4
35.f3 c3
36.Ke2 Rf7
A little reminder that Black still has a rook.
37.Rf1 Kd6
38.Kd3 Kc5
39.Re2 Rb7
40.f4 dxe4+
41.Rxe4 ...
If 41.Kxe4 Kc4 42.fxe5 Bxe5.
41...Rd7
42.Kc2 Kd5
43.Rfe1 Rb7
44.Kc1 ...
After 44.fxe5 Black would be unable to stop the passed pawn; however, he would have good chances to win, not to draw, with 44...Rb2+ 45.Kc1 Rxa2 46.e6 Kc4 47.Kb1 Rb2+ 48.Ka1 Kb3. White would have better in 47.R1e2, but then Black could also improve on 45...Rxa2, by playing 45...Bf2 46.R1e2 Bc5 instead.
44...Rb2
With the same threats. Now the fires of battle slowly begin to subside, and after one more harmless try the game winds up a draw.
45.R4e2 e4 46.Rxe4 Rxa2 47.g4 Rg2 48.f5 gxf5 49.gxf5 Rf2 50.Re7 Kc4 51.R1e4 Kd3 52.Rxd4+ Kxd4 53.Rxh7 a5 54.Rd7+ Ke4 55.h5 Rxf5 56.h6 Rh5
DRAW
154. Smyslov—Geller
(King’s Indian)
One of the postulates of opening theory reads as follows: In the opening, White should always play to gain the advantage, while Black should always play to equalize. I do not know the precise formulation of Geller’s views, but to judge from his games, he apparently believes that whichever side he happens to be playing is the side that ought to get the better of the opening.
The chief characteristics of Geller’s creativity are an amazing ability to extract the very maximum from the opening and a readiness to abandon positional schemes for an open game rife with combinations, or vice versa, at any moment.
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 g6
3.Nc3 Bg7
4.e4 d6
5.Nf3 0-0
6.Be2 e5
7.0-0 c6
8.Re1 exd4
9.Nxd4 Re8
10.Bf1 Ng4
Having developed his pieces harmoniously, Smyslov now wishes to set about a straightforward % siege of Black’s position, without incurring any weaknesses himself. He would like to make the first breach in the fortress wall at d6 — but now this sudden knight sortie, with its unmistakable threat of 11...Qh4, forces Smyslov to recast his plans.
11.h3 Qf6
11...Qb6 comes to the same thing after 12.hxg4 Qxd4 (but not 12...Bxd4 because of 13.Qd2, when the threat of 14.Na4 forces Black into full retreat).
12.hxg4 Qxd4
13.g5 ...
An outstanding idea! Smyslov establishes an outpost in the immediate vicinity of the enemy army’s general headquarters. And although this cheeky pawn is cut off from its own chain, directly or indirectly it holds back three of the enemy. Most importantly, it holds down the thematic King’s Indian thrust ...f7-f5.
13...Nd7
14.Bf4 Qxd1
15.Raxd1 Be5
16.Be3 Nc5
With the queens exchanged, Black is ready to trade bishop for knight as well, if he can get a pawn into the bargain: for example, 17.f4 Bxc3 18.bxc3 Nxe4. So White contents himself with the more modest 17.f3, waiting for the right moment to drive the bishop from e5 and take the d-pawn. A position of dynamic equilibrium results. Black now advances his queenside pawns, but all the while he must keep an eye on the central grouping of his own and the enemy forces.
17.f3 Be6
18.Rc1 a5
19.Rc2 a4
20.a3 Reb8
White’s last move was to defend the b-pawn, so he could transfer the knight via e2 to d4. Geller intended to meet this maneuver with the following aggressive line: 21.Ne2 Nd3 22.Rb1 b5 23.cxb5 Ba2 24.Ra1 Bb3, with interesting complications. If Geller had been in a peaceable mood, he would probably have played 20...f6, and after 21.gxf6 Bxf6 the game would most likely have been drawn.
21.Rb1 h6
Geller decides to liquidate the unpleasant g5-pawn at the precise moment when both White’s rooks are located on the same diagonal, as though to invite an attack from the bishop at f5. However, Smyslov refutes Black’s idea by means of an accurately calculated counterblow.
22.gxh6 f5
23.f4 ...
Geller evidently missed the fact that 23...Bxc3 could now be met by 24.Bxc5 dxc5 25.Rxc3 fxe4 26.Re3 Bf5 27.Be2 Re8 28.Rd1, with a won position.
23...Bf6
24.e5 Be7
25.exd6 Bxd6
26.Rd1 Bf8
27.Nd5 ...
A pretty stroke, in Smyslov’s characteristic style, which leads to complications favoring White. If Black takes the knight with his pawn, he gets into a hopeless position: 27...cxd5 28.cxd5 Ne4 29.dxe6 Bxh6 30.Rc7, or 28...Bxd5 29.Rxd5 Ne4 30.Rc7, intending 31.Bc4, etc.
27...Rd8
28.Nf6+ Kf7
28...Kh8 was much better: on the natural continuation 29.Bd4 he could have sacrificed the exchange with 29...Rxd4 30.Rxd4 Be7 and trap the knight. White would have to give some thought to the extrication of that knight, but it could probably be accomplished by 29.Re1 Be7 30.Bf2: White’s position remains somewhat superior, but Black has defensive possibilities.
29.Rxd8 Rxd8
30.Nh7 Ne4
31.Ng5+ Kf6
32.g4 Rd1
33.Nxe4+ fxe4
34.g5+ ...
Now White’s passed pawn is solidly defended, which assures him the victory.

ROUND TWENTY-THREE
155. Geller—Keres
(Queen’s Gambit)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6
3.Nc3 d5
4.Nf3 c5
5.cxd5 cxd4
6.Qxd4 exd5
7.e4 ...
Once again Keres employs the new defense, specially prepared for this tournament, which he used successfully against Stahlberg (see Game 33). Geller’s plan of attack with 7.e4 takes us out of the realm of the positional schemes of the Queen’s Gambit and into the sphere of the open games of the Italian School. On 7...dxe4, White trades queens (8.Qxd8+ Kxd8) and continues 9.Ng5, attacking the pawns at f7 and e4.
7...Nc6
8.Bb5 Nxe4
9.0-0 ...
Geller plays in classical style. Having sacrificed a pawn, he is in no hurry to recover it, bringing out his pieces instead for an attack on the king.
9...Nf6
Black’s task must be to remove his king from the center at all costs, otherwise an extra pawn or even an extra piece will not save him from a fierce attack. The task is not solved by exchanging knights at c3, since 9...Nxc3 10.Qxc3 would leave the g7-pawn under fire from the white queen, as before, and the dark-square bishop would remain unable to move and clear the way for castling kingside.
10.Re1+ Be7
11.Qe5 ...
One who plays an open game must not only search for and invent various attacks and combinations, but also keep a sharp eye on his opponent, and never forget that he may also come up with a clever idea himself. Thus, at first Geller’s move looks quite strong: it pins the bishop and delays Black’s castling, and on 11...Be6 12.Nd4 is very uncomfortable.
However, Keres finds a pretty combinative solution: even though he “cannot” castle, he does so anyway! Immediately, White’s position is practically hopeless, since he no longer has either his attack or his pawn. So Geller’s correct strategical idea must have fallen victim to an incorrect tactical execution.
Geller could have kept the king in; the center for quite some time by means of the maneuver 11.Bxc6+ bxc6 12.Qe5, when his threats of 13.Nd4 and 13.b3 followed by 14.Ba3 would have forced an immediate 12...Kf8.
11...0-0
Suddenly, Black’s knight is mobile again: 12.Bxc6 Bd6!, and then 13...bxc6.
12.Qe2 Re8
13.Bg5 Bg4
14.Rad1 h6
15.Bh4 ...
White might have won back his pawn instead: 15.Bxf6 Bxf6 16.Qxe8+ Qxe8 17.Rxe8+ Rxe8 18.Rxd5 — but he could hardly have had any hopes of saving the endgame then. White’s knights would have had no points of support, and would have had to stay tied to their posts, while Black’s bishops would hold absolute sway over the board. Sooner or later, White’s a-and b-pawns would have fallen.
15...Ne4
Another little combination: if 16.Bxe7, Black simplifies with 16...Nxc3 17.Bxd8 Nxe2+ 18.Rxe2 Rxe2 19.Bxe2 Rxd8, and eventually wins, being a pawn ahead. If 16.Bxc6 first, then 16...bxc6 defends the d-pawn. 16.Rxd5 is also met by 16...Nxc3, with simplifications favorable to Black, or even the win of the exchange.
16.Bg3 Nxc3
17.bxc3 Bf6
18.Qxe8+ Qxe8
19.Rxe8+ Rxe8
20.Rxd5 Rc8
21.Rd3 ...
This allows a third and final “little combination” — adding up to the equivalent of one “grand combination”. Although 21.Rd3 was condemned by the annotators, it does not alter the outcome, but merely hastens it. After 21.Rc5 Be7 22.Rc4 Be6 23.Ra4 a6 also, Black has an easy win.

This is too pacific. White is preparing to open the center with 11.e4, and from a Reshevsky one might sooner have expected 10...Bb4 11.a3 Bxc3 12.Bxc3 dxc4 13.bxc4 c5 or 13...Be4.
11.e4 dxe4
12.Nxe4 Nxe4
13.Bxe4 Bxe4
14.Qxe4 ...
White has the freer position, with significantly more lines available for various regroupings. Since his darksquare bishop is on the a1-h8 diagonal, it looks very tempting to bring a rook to g3, but he must also counter Black’s efforts to increase the scope of his own pieces by ...c7-c5 or ...e6-e5.

Lengthy maneuvers on interior lines have not brought about any substantial change in the position. White’s next move is a careless one that allows Reshevsky to assume the initiative.
29.Qg4 h5!
30.Qe4 c5!
Well played. Now Black knocks White’s d-pawn out of the center and obtains full play.
31.Rd3 Nc6
32.Red2? ...
White absent-mindedly puts the rook on a bad square. He should have taken the c-pawn first.
32...cxd4
33.Nxd4 Ne5
34.Rc3 Rcd8
35.f4 ...
A very risky decision. The plan to take over the d-file should have been implemented with something like 35.Rc1 and 36.Rcd1. This foolhardy push of the f-pawn could have cost White the game. It decisively weakens two diagonals, both of them vital to White’s health and safety: c5-g1 and a8-h1.
35...Ng4
Of course. Black immediately has a number of combinative threats; among other things, the threat of 36...e5 forces white’s knight to abandon d4 at once.
36.Nf3 Rxd2+
37.Nxd2 Rd8
This returns the favor. Reshevsky feels that White will have a harder time defending the pawns at a3 and b3 once the rooks are exchanged, but Kotov manages to hold on. I would have selected the more obvious 37...f5, especially since the rook already occupies the e-file. After’38.Qf3 e5 39.h3 e4, or 39.fxe5 Nxe5 40.Qd5 Bc5, Black’s pieces would be quite excellently placed, while White’s would have no useful moves. His best would have been 38.Qc6.

45.Qd3 Nf6
46.Nf3 Qxd3
46...Qe7, aiming at the a-pawn, offered somewhat better chances. As the game’s further course will make clear, Reshevsky overestimated his chances in his home analysis. Well, there’s no need for us to regret that, since the knight ending that results is most interesting.
47.Ne5+ Ke7
48.Nxd3 Ne4
49.b4 Kd6
50.Ne5 a4
50...axb4 would have secured the draw, but Black wants to retain his own a-pawn while removing that of his opponent. One cannot fault Reshevsky’s logic, except that Kotov finds an astonishing defense.
51.Kf3 g5
Black is giving it all he’s got. Kotov’s position now looks critical, in view of the threatened 52.-- 52...Nd2+ 53.Ke3 Nb1 54.Kd3 h4, or 52...g4+ 53.hxg4 hxg4+ 54.Nxg4 Nd2+ 55.Ke2 Nxc4, etc.; but by means of a sharp left-hand turn, his king escapes the danger zone.
52.Ke3 ...
A very pretty move — and here are the variations (with the first one very much like a novel):
I. 52...Nc3 — a hunt for the a-pawn — 53.Kd3 Nb1 54.Kc2 Nxa3+ 55.Kb2 — the knight perishes, but the breakthrough comes on the other side — 55...h4 56.Kxa3 hxg3; and if the knight hurries to assist with 57.Nf3?, then 57...gxf4, and the wave of pawns from e6 to f5 to f4 to g3 rolls unopposed to the first rank. But the knight can ride “roundabout”: 57.Nf7+!, and after Nf7xg5-f3, the g-pawn is stopped at the very threshold.
II. 52...Nxg3 53.Nf7+ Ke7 54.Nxg5, and once again, the black knight is mired.
Reshevsky nevertheless finds a way to get to the a-pawn.
52...g4
53.hxg4 hxg4
54.Nxg4 Nc3
55.Ne5 Nb1
56.Kd3 Nxa3
57.b5 ...
This allows Black to give up his knight for two pawns and obtain some real drawing chances. Wouldn’t the simple 57.Kc3 have been better? No, since it turns out that 57...b5 would give Black

White has an obvious positional advantage. Here the transfer of the knight from b3 via d2 to c4 suggests itself; Black would of course be ill-advised to take the d-pawn, since the opening of the d-file and the a2-g8 diagonal would kill him. By missing this opportunity, White cedes the initiative.

Sometimes White can permit himself this kind of tempo-loss in the opening, especially when, as here, the move is not altogether useless. Stahlberg intends to develop his bishop to e3 without fear of ...Ng4.
7...Nc6
8.Nc3 Bd7
Here and later Gligoric avoids exchanges, in order to keep the game complicated. 8...cxd4 9.Nxd4 Nxd4 10.Qxd4 Be6 was also good; if then 11.Bxb7 Bxh3.

12...Nd4
13.Rd1 Bc6
14.Ne1 ...
After playing a rather slow opening, White now removes an important piece from the center unnecessarily and falls into a difficult position. A few exchanges would have been more to the point here: 14.Nxd4 cxd4 15.Rxd4 Rxd4 16.Bxd4 Bxg2 17.Kxg2 Qxc4 18.e3, or 15.Bxd4 Ng4+ 16.hxg4 Rxd4 17.Rxd4 Bxd4 18.e3.
14...b6
15.Bg5 Bxg2
16.Nxg2 Qe6!
Coupled with his next move, this is an outstanding maneuver which leads to the win of a pawn. Its precision appears in the following variations: 17.Qe3 Qxc4 18.Qxe7 Rd7 19.Qe3 Re8, and White is in a hopeless predicament; or 17.Ne3 Ne4, when Black threatens to trap the bishop.
17.Ne3 Ne4
18.Nxe4 Qxe4
19.Nd5 ...
The courage of despair. The white pieces are very poorly placed: the rooks lack scope, the queen is buried, and every pawn stands quite as passively as the next. Even the bishop stands alone, in the middle of Black’s pieces. It is therefore understandable that the Swedish grandmaster should wish to see his knight set free, at least.
19...Qxe2
20.Qe3 ...
The check at e7 would lead to still greater difficulties: 20.Nxe7+ Kf8 21.Qe3 Qxe3 22.fxe3 Nf3+; or 21.Nxg6+ hxg6 22.Bxd8 Qxf2+.

23.Ne7+ Kf8
24.Nc6 Rd6
25.Nxd4 Rxd4
26.Rxd4 cxd4
27.Rd1 e5
An extra protected passed pawn in the center, with chances of making it two connected passed pawns — that’s more than enough to win with. The rest is a matter of uncomplicated technique. Black brings his king to the center, creates a second passed pawn, and by advancing his pawns with the support of the rook, he forces his opponent to lay down his arms.
28.Kg2 Ke7
29.f4 f6
30.Kf3 Ke6

Stahlberg is giving his opponent all the hindrance he can. For the moment, the pawns are blockaded, and the only way to win is to get the rook around in back; in that event, however, White threatens to advance his c-pawn. White is finally betrayed by the undefended status of his rook and Black’s threat to mate on e3 when his rook reaches the second or third rank.

15.Rd1 Qe8
By forcing Black to waste time on the maneuver ...Qd8-e7xd8-e8, White has obtained a small edge in development.
16.Bxf6 Bxf6
White has now removed one of the main defenders of the h7 square. After Black’s bishop recapture (instead of the pawn recapture), Euwe believes 17.Nb5 was worth a look: the knight aims for c7, and if 17...Rd8 18.Nd6. However, after 17...Qe7! 18.Nd6 Be8, White’s advantage evaporates.
17.Ne4 Be7
18.Nfg5 ...
As we leave the opening for the middlegame stage, the chances lie with White. His advantage consists of the more active placement of his pieces and his control of the d-file. White now essays a curious combination, which unfortunately falls short of its mark; so playing the other knight straightforwardly out to g5 was therefore better. After 18.Neg5, Black would have had nothing better than to play 18...g6, and after 19.h4 and 20.h5, the black king’s position might become very unsafe, in view of White’s standing threat to sacrifice a piece at e6 and enter at g6 with his queen. Besides, after 18.Neg5 g6 the square f6 would be seriously weakened, and Black would not have enough time to bring his bishop to g7: 19.h4 Bf6 20.Ne4 Bg7 21.Nd6 Qb8 22.Nxf7.
18...h6
Taimanov courageously meets his opponent’s idea head-on, having more accurately judged the endgame which now arises by force.
19.Nd6 Bxd6
20.Qh7+ Kf8
21.Rxd6 hxg5
By removing this dangerous knight, Black is obviously avoiding all manner of possible surprises.
22.Rxd7 Qxd7
23.Qh8+ Ke7
24.Qxa8 Qd1+
White’s queen is temporarily blocked out of play, and Black quickly goes after the defenseless white pawns.
25.Bf1 Qb3
26.h3 ...
White is too complacent: 26.Qh8 was necessary, followed by an immediate 27.h4. Euwe apparently hoped to close the b-file with Bb5, in which case his queen should certainly be at a8.
26...Qb3;b2
27.a4 Qb6
28.Qh8 ...
A pawn down, White nevertheless has some compensation in his queen, which is very active on the eighth rank.

30...g4

Suddenly the black king is feeling a good deal less than comfortable. A catastrophe appears to be imminent, but “first aid” (...g5-g4-g3) arrives just in time to save “his majesty’s” health.
32...g3
Now, in view of the threatened 33.-- 33...gxf2+ 34.Kxf2 Qh4+, white’s queen cannot leave the h-pawn.
33.Qg8 gxf2+

10.0-0 Nc6
11.a4 ...
By maintaining the pawn tension in the center, Black prevents White’s e3-e4, so Szabo seeks an exit for his bishop on the a3-f8 diagonal. As soon as he plays 11.a4, however, Najdorf immediately closes the center and stations his knight at e4, giving White the choice of trading off his bishop or worrying over his c3-pawn. This game is significant for opening theory, since Najdorf’s 12th move is an improvement on the game Taimanov - Botvinnik from the XX USSR Championship.
11...c4
12.Bc2 Ne4
Botvinnik played 12...Bg4, but his opponent ignored the threat to double his pawns and played 13.Qe1!
13.Qe1 ...
This allows Black to entrench himself firmly at e4. 13.Bxe4 dxe4 14.Nd2 was more in the spirit of the position, since a later f2-f3 would open the f-file for his rook and give his queen an exit to g3.
13...Re8
14.Bb2 Bf5
15.Nd2 Qg5
Black’s pieces are much more actively posted. If Black can hold firm in the struggle for the strategically vital e4 square, then clearly he will have the whip hand.
16.Nxe4 Bxe4
Black’s major task would have been solved by the pawn recapture, which makes use of the fact that the e3-pawn is twice attacked and f2-f3 is therefore impossible. After 16...dxe4, both White’s bishops would remain blockaded for some time. Black could exploit this to create threats against the white king: for example, 17.Qd2 Bg4 (threatening ...Bf3) 18.Kh1 Re6 19.Bd1 Rh6 20.Bxg4 Qxg4 21.f3 Qg3 22.h3 exf3 23.Rxf3 Rxh3+.

24...Nb3 was also possible; White would then have probably replied 25.Rxb3 cxb3 26.Qxa6, and with a couple of pawns for the exchange, he would not be too badly off. So Black holds back on ...Nb3 for a while, waiting until the queen no longer attacks the a6-pawn.

27.Re2 Qd7
28.Bb2 Kh7
29.h3 g6
30.Qf3 Re4
31.g4 ...
31...f5
The f-pawn is the only weak spot in Black’s position. Why not play simply 31...Kg7, defending f6 at the same time? That would have assured the fall of white’s a-pawn, for no compensation, and Black’s win would then have been quite easy.

33.Rg1 Rg8+
34.Kh1 Rxg1+
35.Kg1 Re7
36.Kh1 Qe6
37.Qf4 Rg7
Najdorf wants to force a decision by occupying the g-file. Exchanging queens and pushing his queenside pawns was a sounder idea.
38.Kh2 Qg6
White’s game appears hopeless. Qg6-h5
39.Qg3 Qh5
40.Qf4 ...
A lucky find: White can leave his rook hanging, as long as the black king cannot avoid the perpetual check.
40...Qg6
41.Qg3 Qe8
42.Qf4 Qe4
43.f3 Qd3
DRAW
Indeed, White plays 44.Rg2, and after the rooks are exchanged Black can win the bishop, but not the game, in view of the perpetual check. 43...Qb1 leads nowhere for the same reason. Instead of his actual last move, however, Black could have tried 43...Qxf4+ 44.exf4 Kg8, when 45.Re5 fails to 45...Nd2!, threatening mate in two. If Black’s king gets to the queenside, he will have real winning chances, since he will have an extra pawn, for all practical purposes. Black’s position was so strong that not even two inaccuracies could spoil it completely.

With this standard d-pawn advance, Black wants to bring about a series of exchanges to ease his defense; however, some risk is involved in this, due to the possibility 10.Nxc6 bxc6 11.e5 Nd7 12.f4 e6 13.Na4, when White is better. 11...Ng4 12.Bxg4 Bxg4 13.f4 would also leave Black in a ticklish position, in view of the threatened 14.Bc5. Averbakh chooses a different course.
10.exd5 Nxd5
11.Nxd5 Nxd4
12.c4 ...
This is more interesting than the obvious 12.Bxd4 Qxd5 13.Rad1, etc.: it leaves Black with the problem of whether to keep his knight on d4 or to take the bishop at e2. If he should play 12...Nxe2+ 13.Qxe2 e6, then the quiet 14.Nc3 retains the better chances for White, despite the pair of black bishops, thanks to White’s queenside majority of pawns and his control of most of the central squares. Black finds the best move.

I suppose it’s time to let the reader in on our little secret: up to and including Black’s 17th move, both sides have been replaying a game from the Szczawno-Zdroj tournament of 1950, in which Averbakh was Black. There Geller continued 18.Qd5, and after 18...Qe6 19.Qxe6 fxe6 20.Rd7, secured not the slightest advantage. Now Averbakh is playing White, and has prepared an improvement — however, it does not lead to anything substantial either.

For the price of a pawn, Black has managed to hold White’s king in the center. Far more important in this situation, however, is the opening of the f-file, since even before ...f4xg3, castling would not have been without danger to White, in view of his weakened pawn wall f2-g3-h4. Petrosian plays the next part of the game very resourcefully, and succeeds in warding off his opponent’s threats while retaining his material advantage.
22.fxg3 Nc8
23.Rb8 Nd6
Of course it would have been difficult to calculate accurately all the consequences of 23...e4, but it would have brought about a completely muddled position, in which Black is not without chances — and that was precisely what Szabo aimed for in sacrificing the first pawn.

Black has managed to liquidate all White’s pawn reserves. If only his bishop could help the queen, just a little! Concluding that now, at last, it’s time to come out of the shadows, the bishop shoulders its pawn aside, but — alas! — too late. White’s pieces begin their counterattack, and thanks to their numerical superiority, they sweep all before them.

For some reason, the masters in this tournament seemed to favor defensive systems with a queen’s bishop fianchetto against Najdorf (see, for example, Games 94 and 118). In this game, Najdorf employs one of the best continuations, which forces Black to exchange pawns under most unfavorable circumstances.

White leaves the correct road, and theory can no longer extract anything useful from this game. 11.b4! was more logical, using the knight to support a possible c4-c5. On 11.b4, of course, there might follow 11...Ng4, forcing 12.g3, but there’s nothing terrible about that. Now Black gets in ...d7-d5.

Black’s queen now occupies a square that by rights ought to belong to white’s, and creates a threat to take over the c-file.
23.Qe3 ...
An excellent reply, with the idea of controlling the central light squares with his bishop and the dark squares with his pawns. Despite the fact that this exchange doubles and isolates the white pawns, it is precisely this queen exchange that makes them no longer weak, since the rook will be unable to reach them.

Inconsistent again: by this advance, the b-pawn will leave the c-pawn far behind, and soon the latter will fall — on the d6 square, it’s true, but that’s a mere detail. 10...e5 should have been played at once, and if 11.dxe5 Nxe5 12.Nxe5, he should recapture with the bishop, and not with the queen.

Black is doomed to passive defense. Stahlberg’s last move somewhat fortifies the knight’s position at f5, and makes its rotation between f5 and h6 easier.
41.Ne4 Re8
42.Kf2 Re7
White’s perpetual threat against the f7-pawn has forced Black to allow the exchange of rooks, thus depriving Stahlberg of the hope still beating in his breast of securing a draw in the “three-vs-four rook and pawn ending already known to us. As for the knight and pawn “three-vs-four” ending, that, as we shall see, is a win.

After the eighth rank, there’s nowhere else to go. The author wishes to take this opportunity to dispel a mistaken notion current among some beginners that according to the laws of chess, if a king reaches the eighth rank, one captured pawn may be taken back. In this tournament, several kings made it to the eighth rank, and the reader may see for himself that no pawns appeared on the board as a result. This is a nonexistent “rule”, artificial and contrary to the logic of chess, whose laws are the product of many year’s experience.

The next phase of the struggle sees White pushing back the black king and beginning a right-ward movement of his own.

In the Queen’s Indian we occasionally see a fianchettoed ...king. What would impel White to develop his bishop at g2 and then trade it off immediately? Certainly it is not that the king is so well placed on g2. No, the explanation lies in the fact that in the Queen’s Indian the positional battle hinges on the advance, ...d7-d5. If White can restrain it, he has the better game; if Black enforces it, he equalizes. White therefore trades bishops in order to neutralize the queen’s bishop’s support of this advance, and the king ends up on g2.
In other lines, White plays Nf3-e1, recapturing on g2 with the knight.
9...Qc8
Another typical maneuver in such positions. Black exploits the hanging c-pawn and the king’s position to bring his queen to the long diagonal without loss of time.

What made Reshevsky aim for such a position out of the opening? Isn’t it symmetrical, with no advantage of any kind for White? Symmetrical, yes — but not entirely. Geller has pawns on light squares; consequently, the squares in front of them are dark squares, and White will be able to establish his knight on these squares, where the light-square bishop Geller is now left with cannot drive it away. Further, Black cannot avoid having to play ...c7-c6, and this will create a notch which White’s attacking pawns can grapple. Thus, White has prospects of further strengthening his position, while Black must operate on the kingside whether he will or no — here, however, the
modus operandi
is not so clear.

The obverse of the standard minority attack appears if White simply trades knights: 16.Nxe6 Rxe6 17.b5 Qg5 18.bxc6 Rxc6 19.Qb3 Bh3 20.Bf3 Bxg2!, and Black’s queenside holds, while White’s kingside is already in ruins. The ability to temper attack with defense is one of the chessmaster’s most valued, essential skills. Total immersion in one’s own plan generally leads to underestimating that of one’s opponent. Forgetting this axiom cost Reshevsky a half-point after adjournment.
16...Qg6
17.Ng3 Rac8
18.Rac1 Ng5
Black should always play ...a7-a6 in these cases to induce White to play a2-a4; then, if the “minority” advances any further, it will involve a pawn exchange. The more pawns Black can trade off, the fewer his queenside weaknesses.
19.b5 ...
This break is based on the fact that after 19...cxb5 20.Qb3, no matter how Black replies, White not only wins his pawn back, but gains another as well.
19...Ne4
20.Qa5 ...
The queen attacks the a-pawn. Had Black moved it up to a6 at the proper time, he would be in a great deal less trouble now.
20...c5
In his difficult position, Geller does not lose his resourcefulness or presence of mind. Seeing that “normal” play will result in a slow death for Black, he gives up the pawn and allows White two connected passed pawns, but creates an interesting counterchance in the form of a far-advanced c-pawn. If 21.Qxa7, for example, then 21...c4.
21.Nxf5 Qxf5
22.dxc5 b6!
23.Qxa7 ...
Of course not 23.cxb6? Rxc1 24.Rxc1 Qxf2+.
23...bxc5
24.Bd3 c4
25.Bxe4 Qxe4
26.Rfd1 c3
27.Qd4 ...
Now Geller’s tactics are justified. Fearing the c-pawn’s swift advance, followed by the d-pawn, Reshevsky hurriedly exchanges queens, and now real drawing possibilities begin to appear. Black would have had a harder job after 27.b6 or 27.Rd4, for example: 27.b6 c2 28.Rf1 (but not 28.Re1 d4!).
27...Rc4
28.Qxd5 c2
29.Rd2 Qxd5
30.Rxd5 Ra8
31.b6 Rb8
One of those rare cases in Geller’s career where he overlooks a saving combination, this one based on the white king’s lack of an “airhole”: 31...Rxa3 32.b7 Rb4 33.Rd8+ Kh7 34.b8=Q Rxb8 35.Rxb8 Rd3 36.Rf1 Rc3! Now White has nothing better than to enter a “four-vs.-three” rook-and-pawn ending, which theory considers drawn (cf. Game 150, Gligoric - Euwe).
32.Rd6 Ra4
33.Rxc2 Rxa3
34.h3 Rb3
35.Rcc6 Rb2
36.e4 h5
37.e5 h4
38.Rd4 ...
And here it might seem that nothing could save Black. Nevertheless, I would not have traded my b-pawn for the insignificant h-pawn. Couldn’t White have relocated his rook on the seventh rank? After 38.e6 f6 39.Rc7 R2xb6 40.Rdd7, it seems White’s idea has jelled (and this, by the way, is the same sort of sudden assault on g7 Reshevsky used once before in this tournament, against Euwe).
38...R2xb6
39.Rxb6 Rxb6
40.Rxh4 ...
In order to understand what follows, keep in mind that there are some rook endings in which two extra pawns are not enough to win. As an example, sometimes it is impossible to win the ending with rook and f- and h-pawns against rook, or rook and two connected passed pawns against rook, if the pawns can be blockaded. Geller is hoping to transpose into one of these endgames.

Black has achieved a great deal: his rook and king are active, while White’s pawns are immobilized. Still, had White played 50.Ra8, his two extra pawns would have won in a walk.

168. Keres—Smyslov
(English Opening)
On the eve of the 24th round, Keres was a half-point behind Smyslov, but Keres was due for his bye in the 25th round. In the event of a draw with Smyslov, he would fall either a point or a point and a half behind Smyslov, depending on how the latter scored against Reshevsky in Round 25. Thus, we can see the psychological circumstance which impelled Keres to try his luck with a strange, sharp king-side attack, using only his two rooks without the aid of his pawns.
Keres either could not or would not make methodical and logical preparations for his attack. As early as the 19th move, he offered a rook, as the English expression goes, “for nothing“. Our understanding of sacrifices usually involves some resounding check—Bxh7+ or Rxg7+—forcing one’s opponent to capture the piece. However, the finest sacrifices are a bit different: the rook is attacked, but it does not move...

19.Rch3 ...
“I thought for a long time,“ said Smyslov afterwards, “over whether or not I should give in, and accept the rook — the more so, in that I was unable to see how White would be able to win here... “ Indeed, to take a whole rook for nothing! The worst of it is, what if I don’t take it, and then lose? And look: next move, the rook will take off the h-pawn—well, then, grab it! Calculating all the variations over the board is obviously not possible; all one can do is to examine the main lines and trust in oneself.
19...dxc4
Smyslov’s intuition did not deceive him: as later analysis was to show, he made the best move here. But how did he arrive at it? What sort of mechanism, if one may so call it, operates a grandmaster’s intuition? Did Smyslov reason it out, or did he simply guess, as one might do in a lottery, and pull out a winning number?
Of course the text move resulted from a deep study of the position. First of all, Black is opening his bishop’s diagonal, creating the possibility of transferring that piece via e4 to f5 or g6. Secondly, the d-file is opened, creating the possibility of moving the queen to d5 and attacking the square g2 along the diagonal, or simply taking the d4-pawn with the queen. And thirdly, a passed c-pawn temporarily makes its appearance; it may go on to c3, closing the diagonal of the dangerous white bishop... Meanwhile, the white rook is still
en prise
, and now the basic threat of ...g6xh5 is a real one; for on 20.bxc4, for example, 20...gxh5 21.Qxh5 Be4.
Still, we are all curious to see what might have happened if Black had taken the rook right away — wouldn’t 19...gxh5 20.Qxh5 Re8 have saved him, by opening an escape hatch for the king? No, since White would have cut off his escape with the startling 21.a4!!, threatening 22.Ba3. Some sample lines:
I. 21...dxc4 22.Qxh7+ Kf8 23.Ba3+ Re7 24.Rg3;
II. 21...Qd6 22.c5, and now:
a) 22...bxc5 23.Qh6 Bg7 24.Qxh7+ Kf8 25.dxc5,
b) 22...Qd8 23.c6 Rxc6 24.Ba3 Rd6 25.Qh6 Bxd4 26.Bd3, or
c) 22...Qf4 23.Qxh7+ Kf8 24.Ba3 bxc5 25.Bxc5+ Re7 26.Rg3 Ke8 27.Bb5+.
20.Rxh7 ...
Keres could still have forced a draw by 20.Qg4 c3 21.Bxc3 Rxc3 22.Rxc3 Qxd4 23.Qxd4 Bxd4 24.Rc7 gxh5 25.Rxb7, but he was not looking for a draw when he undertook this attack.
20...c3
Now the bishop can neither take the pawn— 21.Bxc3? Rxc3 — nor retreat — 21.Bc1 Qxd4. Keres finds the best chance.
21.Qc1 Qxd4

ROUND TWENTY-FIVE
169. Smyslov—Reshevsky
(Reti Opening)
In his battle for the right to play a match for the world’s championship, Smyslov had just survived a fierce struggle with Keres; his next opponent, Reshevsky, was just as aggressively inclined.
At this moment, Reshevsky had half a point less than Smyslov, with one more game played. So, strictly speaking, even a win would not have allowed Reshevsky to overtake the leader, while a draw would clearly have been unsuitable. So, like Keres, the American also set himself the task of winning at all costs.

8.Qxc3 d6

A proper move, typical of a Queen’s Indian Defense: Black places his bishop in front of its pawn chain, so that now he need no longer fear white’s d4-d5. If the bishop had remained on b7, it would have been doomed to passivity, whereas now it is fully the equal of White’s bishop on g2.
13.dxc5 Nxc5
14.Qe3 ...
A powerful move, combining the tactical threat of 15.Bxf6 and 16.b4 with the positional idea of either driving the bishop out or inducing the e-pawn’s advance.
14...e5
Black has now more or less neutralized the two bishops. The bishop on e4 stands guard over one, while the other is hemmed in by Black’s pawns. Of course, the d-pawn will be a source of worry, but this is no great danger, as long as Black’s position contains no other weaknesses, white’s following maneuvers aim at getting the black bishop for his knight.

White could also have achieved his ends without this move, since 17.Nf5 would have forced Black to give up the bishop; but Smyslov leaves himself the option of taking the bishop on g6 at a later time, under more favorable circumstances.
17...Bg6

19.Rfd1 Qc7

21.Bg2 ...
Even here, it cannot be said that white’s bishop-pair confers on him any kind of substantial advantage. This is a balanced position, which here presages, not a draw, but rather an interesting struggle. In the course of the next ten or twelve moves, both sides maneuver, while hiding their plans from each other, and await the moment when the constellation of pieces will allow them to take decisive action.
21...Nh5
22.Qc3 ...
22...Nf6
White’s bishops are still restricted, but his darksquare bishop can go to e3, which is the intersection point of two important diagonals. Black should have forestalled this while attempting to seize the initiative on the kingside with 22...f5!
One may imagine that perhaps Reshevsky deliberately refrained from playing this here, in order to play it after White had played e2-e4, and closer to the time-control, for the sake of further complicating matters. However, this tactic proved unsuccessful against Smyslov’s clear, logical play.

We must give this move two exclamation marks, as otherwise we would have to give one to each of Smyslov’s moves. He emerges as the winner of this game from both the chessplaying and the psychological point of view. Reshevsky was unable to fathom the plan behind his moves. Here, Smyslov only feinted at f3-f4, while he was really preparing a battery on the diagonal g1-a7. Now a2-a3 and b3-b4 is the threat, driving the knight away so as to attack the b-pawn. 33.Rc2 was played to eliminate the reply ...Nxb3 after his 34.a3, and to support the break c4-c5 in some lines. As for Black’s pieces, the only difference between their positions now and what it was eleven moves ago is that the king has gone from g8 to h7 — and even this slight change is not to Black’s advantage.
33...f5
Reshevsky now executes his long-delayed thrust, when he no longer has any real choice. The rest follows quite swiftly, presenting a sharp contrast to the deliberate maneuvers of the preceding stage.

36.Bxf4 exf4

A second pawn follows the first, in order to attain the sort of position where, temporarily, the pawn count will be meaningless. If White plays this stage calmly and accurately, his two extra pawns must tell. And, once again, Smyslov comes out on top, despite all of his opponent’s tactical skill.

171. Kotov—Gligoric
(King’s Indian)
In the struggle that is chess, the blockade is not just an important technique, but also one of the elements in the strategic plan. The methods for dealing with any enemy piece may be ranked in descending value as follows: capture (or elimination), exchange, attack, blockade. The attacked piece may be defended in any of several ways: retreat is the simplest, but it may also be shielded, or the attacking piece may be captured. The idea behind the blockade is first to deprive the target piece of its mobility before actually attacking it.
In the most general sense, a blockade may be employed against any piece, including the king, but when we speak of the blockade in practical terms, generally it is in reference to pawns. They are the easiest to blockade, and the most dangerous pieces when set in motion.
Which pieces best fill the role of blockader? First and foremost, of course, the knight, since while it blocks the path of the pawn it also attacks the squares diagonally behind it. The bishop is also useful for this purpose, since it can prevent the advance of several pawns simultaneously. One may-also blockade a pawn with a pawn, but that is a double-edged weapon, since the blockading pawn becomes blockaded itself.
These are the blockade’s simplest facets; the reality of chess is a great deal more complicated. In the Kotov - Gligoric game, Black succeeded in maintaining a blockade of a considerable length of pawn chain, thereby severely restricting, not only the pawns, but the pieces too. Naturally, Gligoric did not achieve all this for nothing: it cost him a great deal of thought — and two pawns.
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 g6
3.Nc3 Bg7
4.e4 d6
5.f3 0-0
6.Be3 e5
7.d5 c5
After the sufferings he endured in his games with Geller and Petrosian from White’s continual threat of c4-c5, Gligoric decides to close the center. Although this does deprive his knight of the square c5, it also retains solid control of d4, even if his e5-pawn should go elsewhere. Kotov’s 8.Bd3 is the natural reaction for White, intending to create threats on the diagonal bl-h7 in the event of ...f7-f5.
8.Bd3 Nh5
9.Nge2 f5
10.exf5 gxf5
11.Qc2 e4!
The first link in Black’s plan of blockade: he brings a white pawn to e4, which remains there until the end of the game, hampering any effort by White to obtain the initiative on the diagonal where his queen and bishop are so threateningly posted. Meanwhile, he frees e5 for his own pieces, and clears an important operating diagonal for his “Indian” bishop, in the event White castles long. For all these advantages, Black has only given up one pawn: an insignificant price, considering the circumstances.
12.fxe4 f4
13.Bf2 Nd7
The black knight wants to get to e5, and White has to get it out of there at any cost, which explains his knight’s retreat to its original square.
White saw nothing attractive in the line 14.e5 Nxe5 15.Bxh7+ Kh8; although White keeps his extra pawn and the semblance of an attack on the king, his position is actually quite hopeless, in view of Black’s threats of ...Nxc4, ...f4-f3, and ...Qg5.
14.Ng1 Qg5
15.Bf1 Ne5
Black has won the first skirmish, and thrown back the enemy forces, but he has yet to win the campaign. After regrouping, White’s pieces move out once again to more active positions.
16.Nf3 Qe7
17.Nxe5 Qxe5
18.0-0-0 Nf6
19.h3 Bd7
Gligoric loves a well-prepared breakthrough. A less patient player would have been unable to restrain himself from playing 19...a6 20.Bd3 b5 21.cxb5 axb5 22.Bxb5 Ba6, with a fearsome attack on the a- and b-files and the long diagonal.
20.Bd3 a6
21.Nb1 ...
Outstanding! Now, after ...b7-b5, White does not take the pawn, but replies Nb1-d2, threatening to drive away the queen, one way or another, from the main blockading square.
21...f3!!
Beautiful play. The maneuver Nb1-d2-f3 could have led to the collapse of Black’s entire blockading position. Gligoric demonstrates that he is a true chess artist in the creative sense by giving up a second pawn in order to deprive the knight of the f3 square and expand the radius of his blockade.
22.gxf3 Nh5
23.Nd2 Nf4
A classic example of a blockaded position. The blockade’s immediate effect embraces four white pawns, but its influence penetrates much deeper: the lightsquare bishop has been turned into a pawn, the knight’s own pawns occupy all of its best squares, and even so mobile a piece as White’s queen is almost totally blockaded as well! Now Black threatens no more and no less than mate in two; and the best defensive move is answered, at last, by the well-prepared breakthrough.
One can only marvel at the great defensive power of White’s position, and at Kotov’s masterful ability to stay on his feet come what may, considering the circumstances.
24.Bf1 b5
25.h4 Kh8
26.Rg1 Bf6
27.Nb3 Rab8
At the critical juncture, Black fails to show the necessary resoluteness. He had to calculate the variations and advance one of his pawns. If 27...a5 fails against 28.cxb5 a4 29.Nd2 a3 30.Nc4 axb2+ 31.Kb1 Qe7 32.e5, when the blockade is broken, then 27...b4 28.Na5 Ba4 29.b3 would be very strong for Black, guaranteeing him at least a perpetual check. He Could, however, also retreat his bishop to d7, continuing the attack.
28.Be1 b4
29.Kb1 Ra8
Black’s rook returns, but White has improved his position considerably: the knight can now go to c1 and thence to d3, lifting the blockade a little.
30.Bg3 Rg8
31.Qh2 ...
31...Rxg3
An exchanging combination on the theme of “interference and decoy”. Once the white f- and e-pawns started moving, Black’s game would crumble.
32.Rxg3 Ne2
33.Qxe2 Qxg3
34.Nc1 a5

37.Bg2 Rg8
38.Rh1 Qg3

The last moves before the time-control were made in a hurry. Black could also have pushed his a-pawn without moving his queen about; nor was White’s next move with his king necessary.
40.Kc2 ...
40...a3
Gligoric could have maintained good winning chances with 40...b3+ 41.axb3 axb3+ 42.Kxb3 Qg7 43.h6 Ba4+ 44.Kxa4 Qb7, or 43.Kc2 Rb8 44.Qg2 Ba4+ 45.Kc1 Qb7.

DRAW
After careful analysis, both sides concluded that Black had no win.
172. Boleslavsky—Taimanov
(Queen’s Indian Defense)
Does White get the advantage from his right to the first move? Every chessplayer asks himself that question, and the answer is not easily discovered.
One is forcefully reminded in this connection of Vsevolod Rauzer, one of our most noted master-theoreticians, whose motto was, “1.e2-e4!, and White wins”. He was probably joking when he said that, but every joke contains its share of truth. This conviction that moving the king’s pawn first gave White the better of it, while 1.d2-d4 led only to a draw, inspired Rauzer to work out amazingly deep and forceful attacking systems in a number of openings: the Sicilian, French, Ruy and Caro-Kann, and many others. Later, of course, it developed that many of his wins owed less to the objective strength of his 1.e2-e4 than to Rauzer’s own creative talent, the exceptionally logical pattern of his thinking, and the accuracy of his calculations. Rauzer’s Attacks and Variations live on, and are still employed to this day, even though it is possible for Black to defend himself successfully against them. So working up forcing lines for use in the opening battle, a fearsome weapon in the hands of such players as Morphy, Chigorin, Pillsbury, Alekhine, Fine and Botvinnik, is a method that works equally well for White or Black. The player who uses a prepared forcing line may very well run into a forced refutation, as indeed happened in some games from the present tournament. There is no player, past or present, who has never made a mistake — an axiom that holds just as true for home analysis as it does for over-the-board play. Which, in turn, means that one cannot, as a rule, gain the advantage this way in the opening.
So there exists a different concept of opening strategy, which may briefly be summarized as follows: that it is not necessary to make the very best moves — only good ones.
This was the creative attitude of Lasker and Capablanca, for example, and it is Smyslov’s too. The advantage of the opening, in this case, is understood to be the right to choose a system of development more suited to the White player’s taste, and which gives him the greatest possible liberty to express his creative ability.
Statistics — a sound approach to the study of mass phenomena — show that White’s opening advantage is quite real. In the various eras of history, in every strong tournament for which records were kept, White held a persistent edge in the number of wins. This advantage of White’s should be considered as a tendency, which manifests itself in the course of dozens or hundreds of games, but which has no bearing on the outcome of any particular game. It would be tremendously interesting to examine this tendency in historical cross-section: has the percentage of games won by White increased or decreased by comparison with what it was, say, 20, 50 or 100 years ago? One peculiar feature should be noted: the stronger the tournament, the weaker the influence of the advantage of the first move. As examples to demonstrate this, one may cite the 1948 World’s Championship Match-Tournament, the 1951 World’s Championship Match (in which White won four games and Black six), and a few other events. Does this mean that eventually the right of the first move will give no advantage at all? Time will tell...
In this game, the reader will find a sample of Boleslavsky’s well-prepared and accurately-calculated opening play, followed by a natural transition into a combinative middle stage, and then an interesting endgame which is a win for White. In conclusion, we have a witty counter-combination by Taimanov.
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6
3.Nf3 ...
The first of White’s “merely good” moves. 3.Nc3 is universally considered “best”.
3...b6
4.g3 Bb7
5.Bg2 Be7
6.0-0 0-0
7.Nc3 Ne4
In contrast to the King’s Indian, where the placement of the white e-pawn makes no difference to Black, in the Queen’s Indian Black has to keep close watch on the e4 square. The difference is easily explained: in the King’s Indian, Black places his center pawns on d6 and e5, leaving his queen’s bishop the excellent diagonal c8-h3 to work on, whereas here the queen’s bishop is developed to b7, with a different working diagonal, a8-h1. Consequently, it follows that the fewer pawns stand in the way from b7 to f3, the better Black’s prospects will be. The next phase of the game could be headed,” The Battle For e2-e4”, and it is Boleslavsky who comes out the victor. Unlike Taimanov, he does not forget his other option, that of shutting the fianchettoed bishop out with d4-d5.
8.Qc2 Nxc3
9.Qxc3 ...
White’s second and third “merely good” moves. Stubborn attempts to secure an advantage by means of 8.Bd2 or 9.bxc3 are still being tried — although the latter move does encounter the powerful rejoinder 9...Nc6 (cf. Najdorf - Averbakh).
9...f5
Opinions are sharply divided over this fashionable move. It is enough to note that some consider it to be a defensive move; others, attacking.
The author possesses a rather limited knowledge of the Queen’s Indian, and although 9...f5 did occur in the third and last encounter between the previous and the present World Champions (Amsterdam 1938, Alekhine - Botvinnik), it would seem to me that Keres is more correct in preferring the unhurried transfer of this bishop to a better square with 9...Be4. In this opening formation, the f-pawn probably belongs at f7: the pawns at d7, e6 and f5 overload the diagonal c8-h3.
10.b3 Bf6
11.Bb2 Nc6
Of course, Black understands that the knight does not belong at c6; he is merely using that square as a springboard to bring the knight to the king’s wing. However, this costs Black another move, which enhances White’s initial advantage.
With his advantage in time, White methodically prepares, and then carries out, the important push d4-d5, cutting the black bishop’s mobility to nil.
12.Rad1 Qe8
13.Qc2 Nd8
14.d5 ...
Black could no longer prevent this aggression: on 13...Ne7 14.d5 would also have been the reply, since 14...Bxb2 15.Qxb2 exd5 16.Ng5 Qg6 17.Nh3 favors White.
14...Bxb2
15.Qxb2 exd5
White’s pawn must be removed from d5 at all costs: if Black plays passively, then 16.Nd4, and the opening of the center with e2-e4 is not to be prevented.
16.cxd5 c5
17.dxc6 dxc6
18.Ne5! Rf6
One can only describe Black’s position as “ailing”. As you can see, one need not make gross blunders in order to lose a game; sometimes it is enough merely to have played the opening superficially. Still, beginning with this move, Taimanov starts to play at full power, demonstrating his customary resourcefulness and invention.
19.f4 ...
Boleslavsky’s combinative style has one feature peculiar to himself: strict logic intertwined with his tactical strokes. A player of Smyslov’s or Makogonov’s style would probably have played the more cautious 19.Rd2 followed by 20.Rfd1, and if 19...Re6, then the temporary retreat 20.Nd3.
19...Nf7
20.Rd7 ...
Forcing a series of exchanges.
20...Nxe5
21.fxe5 Qxd7
22.exf6 ...
A most unusual position for the white f-pawn, which has now gotten behind the f5-pawn’s back!
22...Rf8
23.fxg7 Qxg7
24.Qxg7+ Kxg7
25.e4! fxe4
26.Rxf8 Kxf8
27.Bxe4 ...
And is that all? — the reader asks. Yes, and that’s not so little, either. It is a well-known truth that the importance of a weakness increases as the number of pieces on the board decreases.
Here, White has at least three advantages:
1) his bishop is active, while Black’s is not;
2) he can create a passed pawn on the g- or h-file before Black can create one;
3) he can also get his king to the center more quickly.
These advantages are quite sufficient to win.
27...h6
28.Kf2 Ke7
29.Kf3 a5
30.Kg4 Bc8+
This is proper: Black sacrifices a pawn to activate his bishop. With the passive 30...Kf6 31.Kh5 Kg7 32.g4, followed by 33.g5, Black would lose without a struggle.
31.Kh5 c5
32.Kxh6 Kf6!
Black is defending excellently. white’s king will be pinned to the h-file, where it blocks the pawn’s advance.
33.Bf3 a4
A trial balloon: White must now decide whether the black threat of ...a4-a3 followed by ...Bc8-f5-b1xa2 or ...Bc8-e6xb3 is dangerous or not.
34.bxa4 ...
Boleslavsky has concocted an interesting combination, but Taimanov finds a surprising loophole. The immediate 34.g4 was better, since White gets his pawn to g8 before Black can set up his breakthrough on the opposite wing.
34...c4
35.g4 c3
36.g5+ Ke5
37.Bd1 Bg4
38.Bc2 Bf5
39.g6! Bxc2
40.g7 ...
Doubtless expecting 40...Bb3 41.axb3 c2 42.g8=Q c1=Q 43.Qg5+, trading queens, after which White’s h-pawn queens.
40...Bh7
Taimanov’s improvement. Black succeeds in avoiding the exchange of queens, since the white king has to abandon the g5 square.
41.Kxh7 c2
42.g8=Q c1=Q
43.Qb8+ ...
The queen ending is none too pleasant for Black either, but still it is a queen ending, with all of its attendant drawing chances. This sudden turn in a game which White had thought was already over knocks him off his stride. For the remainder of the game, Boleslavsky appears to be playing somewhat planlessly; eventually, he overlooks a drawing queen exchange himself.
43...Kd5
44.Qb7+ Ke5
45.Qg7+ ...
He ought to have chopped off the b-pawn without further ado.
45...Kd5
46.Qf7+ Ke5
47.h4 Qc2+
48.Kg7 Qxa4
49.Qf6+ Ke4
50.Qe6+ ...
And here he ought to have sent his pawn a-queening. White is only driving the black king closer to his h-pawn.
50...Kf4
51.h5 Kg5
52.Qe5+ Kg4
53.h6 Qd7+
54.Kf6 Qd8+
55.Kf7 Qd7+
56.Qe7 Qd3
57.Qe6+ Kh5
58.Ke8 b5
This pawn advance looks harmless for White; does it make any difference whether it’s on b6 or b4? White carelessly repeats moves.
59.Ke7 b4
60.Ke8 Qg6+!
DRAW
agreed: after 61.Qxg6+ Kxg6 62.Kd7 Kxh6 63.Kc6 Kg6 64.Kb5 Kf7 65.Kxb4 Ke8 66.Kb5 Kd8 67.Kb6 Black’s king reaches c8 just in time. With Black’s pawn at b6 (or b5), the exchange of queens would not have been playable, since the white king would have time to occupy b7, securing the route a2-a4 ...a8=Q.
173. Stahlberg—Najdorf

1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 g6
3.g3 Bg7
4.Bg2 0-0
5.Nc3 c5
6.d5 e5
A defense which Najdorf used frequently prior to this tournament, up until its demolition at the hands of Euwe in Game 58. After a lengthy recess, Najdorf is employing it again, without fear of Euwe’s 7.Bg5, which he intends to meet with 7...d6 8.Ne4 Qa5+, or 8.Qd2 a6.
7.Nf3 d6
8.0-0 Nbd7
9.Qc2 Qe7
10.e4 a6
11.a4 Nh5
12.Bd2 Kh8
Black is preparing for the freeing and counterattacking move ...f7-f5 by playing the maneuver ...Nd7-f6-g8. The immediate 12...f5 would be a poor move in view of 13.Ng5 Ndf6 14.exf5 Bxf5 15.Nge4, and the pin is not dangerous to White, with his knight so well defended. In this line, 14.Ne6!? is also interesting: after 14...Bxe6: he king’s bishop’s diagonal could be opened.
13.a5 ...
While Black is busily executing his complicated maneuvers on the kingside, White threatens to block the queenside, and then to continue with 14.Na4 and 15.b4, outstripping his opponent’s attack. So Najdorf’s next sharp move is practically his only means of holding the balance.
13...b5
14.cxb5 ...
Stahlberg decides to give up the exchange for a strong passed a-pawn; later, he was to conclude that the simple 14.axb6 was better, retaining a positional advantage. This self-criticism is commendable, but I do not consider the move Stahlberg actually made in any way inferior to 14.axb6.
14...axb5
15.Nxb5 Ba6
16.Na3 ...
If White had been afraid to lose, he could have continued 16.Nc7 Bxf1 17.Bxf1 Rac8 18.Nb5, when Black would have nothing better than to return his rook to a8. Stahlberg goes for the win.
16...Bxf1
17.Rxf1 ...
Having given up the exchange, White ought to advance his passed pawn as quickly as possible; for this purpose the rook is better placed at a1, and the bishop at f1. If Black can blockade the a-pawn, he will probably have the advantage.
17...Nhf6
18.Nc4 Ne8
19.Bh3 Ra7
20.Be3 Rb7
White was threatening 21.b4.
21.Ra1 ...
Most unhappily, Stahlberg returns his rook to a1. Had he recaptured with the bishop at move 17, then here he might have played (other things being equal) 21.a6, when everything would have looked quite a bit different.
21...Nc7
Just in time to head off the threatened a5-a6-a7.

The exchange of queens has led to a difficult endgame, in which the chances clearly lie with Black, but the play is very complicated, with eight pieces wandering about the board, any one of them capable of surprises.
It is instructive to follow the way both players try to cut down the mobility of the opposing pieces by tying them down to the defense of weak points. Black’s rook and knight are tied to the d-pawn, while White’s knight, bishop and rook defend the pawn at a5, the pawn at d5, and the knight at f5. Black’s king now approaches the battlefield.
36.Bh3 Kf8
37.Kg2 Raf7
38.Nh4 fxg3
39.fxg3 Nd4
40.Be6 ...
An interesting, although insufficient, chance, which serves to complicate yet again what would appear to be a rather simple position. If 40...Nxe6, then 41.dxe6 Rxe6 42.Nxd6 Rd7 43.Rf1+, etc. Najdorf finds an equally interesting rebuttal.
40...Rf2+
41.Kh3 Rf1
The game was adjourned here; after analysis, Black confidently converted his advantage into a win.
White has his choice of rooks. Had Stahlberg played 42.Bxf7, the continuation might have been: 42...Rxd1 43.Bh5 Ra1 44.Nxd6 Nxd5 45.Nb7 e4 46.Nxc5 e3 47.Ng2 e2 48.Nd3 Nf6 49.Bg4 h5 50.Bc8 Nf3, and Black wins a piece. This variation is Najdorf’s, and bears witness to the way he spent the time between the first and second sessions.

175. Szabo—Averbakh
(Sicilian Defense)
A curious game. Szabo twice overlooked the same sort of “little combination” on the same square, d4; after Averbakh’s inaccuracies, however, he was still able to achieve a draw.
1.e4 c5
2.Nf3 Nc6
3.Bb5 g6
4.0-0 Bg7
5.Nc3 d6
6.d3 ...
A comparatively rare and not a very active system of the Sicilian. White is not in a hurry to play d2-d4; and since his pawns all stand on light squares, he makes no secret of his willingness to exchange his light-square bishop.
6...Bd7
7.Nd5 e6
8.Ne3 Nge7
9.c3 0-0
10.d4 Nxd4
An unpinning technique, which consists of an attack on a different enemy piece with the pinned piece, while simultaneously attacking the pinning piece. Another example of this technique occurs with the black queen at d8, the knight at f6, white’s bishop at g5 and his queen at c3: Black plays ...Ne4, attacking the queen with his knight and also the bishop with his queen.
This “little combination” does not cost White material, but it does free Black’s game.
11.Nxd4 cxd4
12.Bxd7 dxe3
13.Qxd6 ...
This rather risky continuation is the only way to avoid losing a pawn.
13...exf2+
14.Rxf2 Nc6
15.Bf4 Qb6
16.Rd1 ...
It was time for White to end this foolishness, capture on c6, and play his other bishop to g5.
16...Rad8
17.Qc7 Bd4
Once again, in the same spot! Black closes the rook’s line of fire, which deprives the bishop on d7 of protection. Then he swiftly doubles rooks, winning the d-pawn: a most elegant combination.
18.cxd4 Qxc7
19.Bxc7 Rxd7
20.Bg3 f5
Averbakh no doubt thought he could always take the pawn. If he takes it at once, there would be complications: 20...Rxd4 21.Rxd4 Nxd4 22.Be5 Nc6 23.Bf6, or 22...Rd8 23.Bf6 Rd7 24.Kf1 Nc6 25.Rc2. On 20...Rfd8 there could follow 21.Rdf1 Nxd4 22.Bh4 Rc8 23.Bf6, and in either case the win for Black is unclear, despite his pawn to the good.
Black wants to ensure the best possible conditions for his knight, while preventing the above-mentioned possibility Bf6.
21.d5! ...
Black expected to force either the exchange or advance of White’s e-pawn, which would have meant a further strengthening of the knight’s position at c6; for example, 21.exf5 Rxf5 22.Rxf5 gxf5 23.Bf2 Rd5! and 24...e5. However, Szabo has found a clever counter: if 21...fxe4? 22.Rxf8+ Kxf8 23.Rf1+ and 24.dxc5. So Black must take on d5, and an equal ending results.

12.Qc2 Qe7
Toward the end of the tournament, the grandmasters began to lose some of their inventiveness in the openings. Here, Averbakh repeats the opening of Game 39, Bronstein - Euwe, which led to a position rife with chances for White. Euwe played 12...Re8 in that game, hoping thereby to prevent White’s e3-e4 for sometime; however, it turned out to be playable after all, since the opposition of queens allowed White to answer (after 13.e4) 13...exd4 14.cxd4 cxd4 with 15.Nxd4 (12...Qe7 is no more effective in this regard). After Zurich, everyone plays 12...Re8!, hoping for the continuation 13.e4 c4!
13.dxe5 Nxe5
14.Nxe5 Qxe5
15.Re1 Bd7
Now the opening is over. The advance e3-e4 remains the underlying theme for the present, but there will be other themes as well, for example: White’s queen’s bishop is walled in by its own pawns, and Black later sacrifices a pawn in order to keep it imprisoned; White no longer has his king’s knight, that sturdy defender of the king’s wing, which inspires Euwe to devise and execute a sharp attack against the white king. In general, Black must be acknowledged to have solved his opening problems successfully; his last move (15...Bd7), however, is really a tactical trap, and does not fit into the greater plan: if now 16.e4, then 16...Ba4! 17.Qxa4? Qxc3. But Black’s intended kingside attack would have become much stronger after 15...Re8, intending to meet 16.e4 with 16...Ng4 17.f4 Qh5 18.h3 c4, obtaining good play. 16.Bb2 would be met as in the game with 16...c4.
16.Bb2 c4
A brave move, and a beautiful one, too: White’s c-pawn is nailed down — he never does play c3-c4 in this game — and eventually the white queen’s bishop falls without ever having attacked anything. There is an element of tactics here as well: Averbakh must pay close attention to the diagonal c5-g1, since a check by Black’s queen at c5, attacking the bishop on c4, could prove most unpleasant for White.
17.Bxc4 Ng4
18.f4 ...
On 18.g3 Black invades the light squares by means of a technique which should be familiar to every chessplayer: 18...Qh5 19.h4 Ne5 20.Be2 Bg4.
18...Qc5
Put the bishop back on c8, put the rook on e8 instead, and you will see that, after 15...Re8, the move 16.Bb2 would have been simply bad for White.
19.Qd3 Rad8
20.Rad1 ...
In conjunction with his previous move, this is a bold and original idea, marking Averbakh as a genuine artist (it goes without saying that deep calculation was necessary too). Many would have fallen for the move Najdorf recommends here, 20.Qd4, but this leads to immediate destruction by 20...Qh5 21.h3 Bc6! 22.hxg4 Qxg4, when Black wins the queen for rook and minor piece.
20.Bd5 was tempting, but then one of the symmetrical bishop retreats (to e6 or c6, f5 or b5), combined with the threat of ...Nxe3, would probably have given Black, if not the better of it, then at least the opportunity to enter a quiet endgame. Now, however, in spite of Euwe’s outstanding defense, white maintains his extra pawn.
20...Qb6
Black defends the rook, and once again threatens ...Ba4, while simultaneously hitting the bishop.
21.Qe2 ...
White gets his queen out of danger, defends his queen’s bishop, and attacks the knight, forcing a quick resolution.
21...Nxe3
22.Qxe3 Qxb2
23.Re2 Qb6!
Attack and defense are both at their peak. Black brings about an exchange of queens (24.Qxb6 axb6), as if he did not see White’s threat of doubling on the d-file, winning a piece. However, this exchange is Black’s only means of holding the game: the bishop does not fall, since Black can attack White’s bishop with his rook and unpin (25.Red2 Rc8).
24.Qxb6 axb6
25.Re7 ...
25...Be6
26.Rxd8 Rxd8
27.Bxe6 fxe6
28.Rxb7 Rc8
29.Rxb6 Rxc3
30.Ra6 Kf7
So now it’s an ending, in which White has an extra rook’s pawn, but Black can attack it from behind with his rook: such endings are generally drawn. The pawn is unable to advance without the aid of the king; and in the time it takes for the king to get to the a-file, Black’s rook or king can pick off a brace of kingside pawns. After that, if worse comes to worst, Black can always give up his rook for the passed pawn.
31.Kf2 h5
32.a4 Ra3
33.h4 Kf6
34.Ra5 g6
35.Ke2 Rg3?
The textbook maneuver 35...Ra2+ would have secured an easy draw.
36.Rg5! ...
Now the white rook defends both pawns, freeing the king to support the passed a-pawn.

177. Petrosian—Stahlberg
(Sicilian Defense)
This entire game is an excellent illustration of Petrosian1s style: its highly individual positional pattern and its logical consistency combine to create a harmonious whole and an artistic achievement. Curiously, not one of the annotators of this game, Stahlberg among them, could find a single sizable error on Black1s part! The contemporary game operates on such fine nuances that they prove difficult to isolate, even in analysis, to say nothing of over-the-board play.

10.Re1 ...
The reader will doubtless have noted that Petrosian is playing a King’s Indian Defense with the White pieces. Defense against what? The King’s Indian is usually played in reply to 1.d4, but here Black has not played the corresponding 1...d5; his setup looks more like a Dragon Sicilian. Thus, we are dealing once again with our old friend the clash of openings, in which both sides arrange their pieces in accordance with predetermined schemes, and bide their time, each occupying only his own half of the board, without as yet encountering the other.
10...Ng4
11.c3 h6
12.Qe2 Kh7
13.Nfd2 f5
Lulled by his opponent’s apparently pacific deployment, Black initiates the conflict. This is a serious inaccuracy, whereby he weakens not only his king-side, but the central squares too. It would have been most sensible for him to place his queen on c7 (instead of c8), his rooks on e8 and d8, and prepared gradually for ...d6-d5.

15.dxe4 Nf6
16.Nf3 Bg4

20.Qc2 ...
White’s position is uncoiling like a spring: his pieces and pawns turn out to be as harmoniously placed for action in the center as on the right flank. Black has weak pawns at d6 and e6, and a tornado threatens to sweep away all obstacles on the b1-h7 diagonal as well.
20...Ne7
21.Nc4 Ne8
22.Bd2 Qc6

Pressed by White’s central and kingside superiority, Stahlberg seeks chances on the other side, but White’s position is solid here too.

30.h4 Kg8

32.e5 ...
An elegant breakthrough! Now 32...d5 33.h5 leads to a completely hopeless position for Black. Taking the pawn looks relatively harmless, and would appear to give Black counter-chances, for example: 32...dxe5 33.Nxe5 Bxe5 34.fxe5 Qc6+. Petrosian’s idea, however, is much subtler.
32...dxe5

37.Ne3 Na5
The e-pawn hangs by a thread, but Black cannot take it, either here or on the next move. For example, if 37...Nxe5 38.Nxe5 Rxe5 39.Rxe5 Bxe5 40.Nxc4 Bg7 41.Be3, and White wins the a-pawn: 41...a6 42.Ra1 Nc7 43.Bb6.

43.Ra4 Rc7
44.Nf3 Nb6
45.Rg4 Kh7
46.Nd4 Re8
Black has lost a pawn, but his weaknesses still remain. So White can fully expect to win, but some accuracy is still required: the queenside pawns must be secured, and if the e-pawn really must be given up, then only in exchange for the a-pawn, so as to set up connected passed pawns as quickly as possible. This is the point of his next few moves.

An important innovation by Najdorf. Moving the knight on f3 to e5 injects new possibilities into an apparently harmless variation. After the tournament, the conclusion was reached that 8...Nfd7! 9.Nd3 Nc6 is Black’s best line here. The move Boleslavsky selected is more natural, but it’s exactly what Najdorf was counting on.
8...Qc7
9.Nd3 Nc6
10.Nc3 Bf5
11.Bf4 Qa5
12.Bd2 ...
The harrying of the black queen continues. Black must now make the important concession of his lightsquare bishop, leaving White’s fianchettoed bishop without an opponent. The effects of this will be felt for the rest of the game.
12...Bxd3
13.exd3 Qc7
14.Be3 Rfd8
Nowadays a player will select a move not according to the external characteristics of a position, but by concretely evaluating its possibilities. Here, Black could occupy d4 with his knight, but he sees that this would leave him with insufficient prospects for the further strengthening of his position. Meanwhile, White could play Rab1 and b4, etc.; and with his bishop working on the diagonal h1-a8, he could work up some serious threats to Black’s queen’s wing. During all this, practically the only thing the knight on d4 would accomplish would be to cover the weak pawn on d3 from frontal attacks along the d-file. This is why, instead of the “strategic” ...Nd4, Black selects the combinative ...Rfd8, aiming directly at the d-pawn.
15.Bxc5 Ne5
16.d4 Nxc4
17.Qe2 Nd6
A series of subtle changes has occurred. White’s queen’s bishop has migrated to c5, where it cramps Black’s activities. White’s d-pawn has moved up a square, but it remains just as isolated, and therefore just as weak, as it was before.
But is it really weak? It is common practice to talk about an isolated pawn’s shortcomings and neglect its positive aspects. One such aspect is the absence of pawns on the neighboring files, which is a point for the “isolated” side, as long as he can bring his major pieces to those files. And so it is here: the absence of pawns on the c- and e-files is clearly not favorable to Black. The queen, for example, stands quite uncomfortably at c7, and the far-reaching power of White’s bishops is also making itself felt. Under these circumstances, Black takes the only proper decision: to attack and eliminate the d-pawn supporting White’s center as quickly as he can.
18.a4 e6
19.a5 Nf5
20.a6 Nd5
Black mistakenly stops halfway. 20...b6 would have achieved both of Black’s goals by driving the bishop from c5 and eliminating the d-pawn. After 20...b6 21.Bxa8, Black would also have had the pleasant choice of which bishop he wishes to leave White; I would have left him the dark-square bishop, since after 21...Rxa8 22.Ba3 Nxd4 the position complicates in a manner unfavorable to White. However, the intermediary 22.Nb5 strengthens the defense, so perhaps Black would be better advised to take the other bishop: 21...bxc5, and after 22.Bg2 cxd4 he has a strong passed pawn.
Then Black’s pressure on the b-file, combined with the advance of his d- and e-pawns supported by his fianchettoed king’s bishop, would have assured him even chances, despite his small material deficit. Boleslavsky selects another, quieter continuation, but it leaves the bishop at c5 undisturbed, and creates two new weaknesses for Black at a7 and d5.
21.axb7 Qxb7
22.Nxd5 exd5
23.Ra4 a5

25.Rb1 Qb3
White’s pressure is becoming unbearable, so Black seeks to exchange queens; however, this should have cost him a pawn.
26.Qxb3 Rxb3
27.Rxa5 ...
The chief drawback of this exchanging operation is that it costs White his most active piece, that being the bishop at c5. He could have maintained his two bishops with 27.g4, which would have led to the loss of a pawn for Black in a considerably inferior position: 27...Nh4 28.Be7, or 27...Nh6 28.h3, and the pawns on d5 and a5 will not long survive.
27...Bxd4
28.Bxd4 Nxd4
29.Bxd5 Rb4
30.Kg2 ...
White has now the very difficult task of queening his b-pawn, a task rendered more complicated by all those enemy pieces on dark squares, where they are very hard to drive out. Now White’s king will approach the battlefield. Black decides to enforce the exchange of the last pair of minor pieces, which completely immobilizes the b-pawn.
30...Nb3
31.Bxb3 Rxb3
32.Ra3 Rb4
An interesting rook endgame, and beyond doubt an instructive one as well. White wants to achieve the following, if possible: bring his king over to the b-pawn, trade off one rook, and not allow the black king to reach his pawns.

34.b3 R8b7
35.Kf1 Kg7

The first part of the plan is now complete, but Boleslavsky’s clever rook maneuver once again throws White’s king back to the d-file.
39.Rc3 Re6
40.Re3 Rc6+
41.Kd2 g5
The point of this move is to break up White’s pawn structure, and most probably White should have replied with the same pawn advance: 42.g4. Of course, after that Black could have maneuvered ...Rc6-h6-f6-h6, to try to tie one of White’s rooks to the h-pawn, but as long as White did not swerve from his basic plan of advancing his b-pawn, Black’s defense would still have been very difficult. For example: 42.g4 Rh6 43.h3 Rf6 44.f3 Rh6 45.b4 Rxh3 46.b5!, and if 46...Rb6, the king goes after the rook.
42.Re4 Rd8+
43.Ke1 Rh6
44.h4 gxh4
45.gxh4 f5
Najdorf has, somewhat overconfidently, allowed Black to dismember white’s f-, g- and h-pawns, resulting in the exposure of white’s king. Black’s rooks can now threaten to check on the ranks as well as on the files, and the black king’s chances are also greatly enhanced. In such circumstances, it is hard to fix your attention on any one thing in particular, and so the pawn at b3 takes only one more forward step.
46.Rc4 Re6+
47.Kf1 ...
The king returns home — and immediately a black rook comes knocking.
47...Rd2
48.b4 Ree2
49.Rf4 Kf6
50.Rb3 ...
Black’s clever defense has won his pieces a great deal of activity. The fact that he no longer blockades the b-pawn does not mean at all that he is letting it slip away from his attention. Two rooks on the second rank are a powerful force. Here, for example, on 50.b5 there could follow 50...Rb2, when 51.Rfb4 is not playable due to 51...Rxf2+. In addition, Black threatened 50...Ke5, driving White’s rook from f4, which is the intersection of the lines f4-b4 and f4-f2. white’s last move meets that threat, since 50...Ke5 51.Rbf3 would cost Black the f-pawn.
50...Rb2
51.Rxb2 Rxb2
51.Rff3 would have been met by 51...Rxf2+!
52.Kg2 ...
The b-pawn cannot get far without the king’s help — but how can he throw his f- and h-pawns away? If he leaves them to the black king, then even if he succeeds in queening his b-pawn, Black will be able to give up his rook at the queening square and draw by keeping either his f- or his h-pawn.

In Ragozin’s Defense, the abstract concept of White’s opening advantage assumes a concrete form: the black knight stands in front of the pawn at c7, which must sooner or later become, the target of an attack, and the d-pawn remains artificially isolated for some time. In return, Black obtains what is referred to as good piece play. There is no disputing that in the eyes of Schlechter, Teichmann or even Rubinstein, the backward pawn was something more substantial than lively piece play, but in our day the latter is more often preferred.
Taimanov’s next move initiates a plan of gradually accumulating small positional advantages. First he secures control of his open file.
12.Rfc1 Bd6

14...c5 must be prevented, and he would like to induce 14...b6.

Having squeezed as much as he could out of his pressure on the c-pawn, and seeing that it is, nevertheless, still standing, White switches to the e-file. The immediate 24.e4 would not have been effective, since the black knight could go to d5. White must create conditions such that a trade of pawns on e4 will lead to an immediate attack on the black queen.
24...f5
One more positional achievement for White: Black’s f-pawn now hinders the mobility of his own pieces, and the weakening of the diagonal a2-g8 will make itself felt later. On the other hand, Kotov played this move intentionally: had he feared the difficulties just mentioned, he could have played 24...Qf6.

This was more or less forced. Attempting to strengthen his grip on e4 with something like Nd2, f2-f3 and e3-e4 would have led to a powerful reactivation of Black’s pieces, which have been observing the white king-side for some time.
The text move conceals a trap: 25...axb4 26.axb4 c5 27.Nb2 c4 28.Nxc4! dxc4 29.Bxc4 Nd5 30.Bxd5 Qxd5 31.Rxc7.
25...axb4
26.axb4 Bd6
27.Rb1 b5
This was almost forced: 27...c5 28.b5 c4 was impossible due to 29.Rxc4! dxc4 30.Bxc4 Nd5 31.Qb3, and, in any case, Taimanov was planning to push
his
pawn to b5.
28.Nc5 Bxc5
29.Rxc5 Ra4
30.Ne5 Rba8
31.Qe2 Be8
32.Qf3 Ra1
33.Rcc1 Rxb1
34.Rxb1 g6
Thus, White has achieved all a positional player could ask for. With lightsquare bishops on the board, five of Black’s pawns stand on light squares; White’s knight occupies an ideal position in the center, and cannot be driven away; and Black’s pieces are tied down to defending the weak g- and c-pawns, which stand on open files. If only White could also occupy the a-file with his rook!
What sort of attacking plan should White select? Since his opponent’s weaknesses are fixed on light squares, he should attack the light squares, following this rough scheme (and adjusting, naturally, for his opponent’s reactions): h2-h3, Kh2, Rg1 and g2-g4; or he can retreat his queen and then play f2-f3 and e3-e4. Taimanov’s following moves, f2-f4 and h2-h4, destroy the possibility of a breakthrough on the light squares, and about three-quarters of his chances as well.
35.h4 Kg7
36.Qg3 Qd6
37.f4 h5
38.Be2 Ra4?!
Convinced that White has no threats any more, Kotov takes the game out of the realm of chess and into that of psychology, inviting his opponent to take the h-pawn, expecting something like this: 39.Bxh5 Rxb4 40.Rxb4 Qxb4 41.Bxg6 Bxg6 42.h5 Qd6 43.Kf1, etc. —but even this is hardly advantageous to Black, especially as White also has 39.Bxh5 Rxb4 40.Rc1.
It should be noted here that this psychological experiment owed its existence in large measure to the sporting situation: had he won this game, Kotov would have improved his tournament standing substantially, overtaking Keres and settling just a half-point behind Reshevsky.
39.Bd1!! ...
A brilliant rejoinder. Without deciding yet whether or not he will take the h-pawn, Taimanov forces the rook to declare itself. If it abandons the a-file, then he will take the pawn. The position of the white bishop, and its simultaneous action against a4 and h5 are strongly reminiscent of the powers of the king in Russian draughts — could that be where the bishop’s move was taken from?
39...Rxb4
40.Ra1 ...
White’s dreams have come true: the rook rips through to the eighth rank, and sows utter turmoil.
40...Nc8
The power of White’s rook and the shortcomings of Black’s position become clear in the following line: 40...Bf7 41.Ra7 Rb1 42.Qg5 (now White doesn’t even need his bishop) 42...Rxd1+ 43.Kh2 Kf8 44.Qh6+.
41.Ra8 Qe6
42.Bxh5 Kf8
43.Bxg6 Bxg6
44.Nxg6+ Ke8
45.Ne5 Kd8
46.Qg7 Ra4
47.Rb8 c5
48.Rb7
BLACK RESIGNED
180. Gligoric—Geller
(King’s Indian)
The second game between these two players bore a great deal of resemblance to their first: the same opening with colors reversed, the same sort of difficult, engrossing endgame — the only difference was the result.
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 g6
3.Nc3 Bg7
4.e4 d6
5.Nf3 0-0
6.Be2 e5
7.0-0 c6
8.d5 ...
Driving a wedge between two wings, White splits the arena of battle into two independent sectors. Geller immediately begins his operations in the region nearest the enemy king, while Gligoric comes up with a roundabout maneuver: first he breaks on the queen’s wing, and only then does he go after the king. The next few moves are easy to understand, but this is not a position amenable to precise evaluation. In such cases, the player who puts more fantasy, courage and logic into his plan will be the winner.
8...c5
9.Ne1 a6
10.Be3 Ne8
11.Nd3 f5
12.f3 f4
13.Bf2 g5
14.b4 ...
With this, Gligoric intends to exploit the opening of the b-file: there is no chance of a break at c5.
14...b6
15.bxc5 bxc5
16.Rb1 Rf6
The rook is shunted to g6, to support the pawns’ assault.
17.Na4 Nd7
18.g4 fxg3
19.hxg3 Rg6
20.Ne1 Ndf6
21.Nb6 Rb8
22.Nxc8 Rxb1
23.Qxb1 Qxc8
24.Kg2 g4
Both sides have gotten closer to their goals: Black now begins a determined assault on g3, while White mounts an invasion, beginning with Qb6.
25.Nc2 gxf3+
26.Bxf3 Bh6
27.Qb6 Qd7
28.Qxa6 Qg7
29.Rh1 Bf4
30.Rh3 h5
White has shored up g3 as well as he could. Now Black’s last reserve, the h-pawn, comes running to the aid of his pieces.
31.Kh2 Ng4+
32.Bxg4 hxg4
33.Rh5 Bg5
34.Qc8 ...
Who has the better of it? There is good and bad in both positions: for instance, White has a pawn more, but his rook stands poorly at h5. We generally say such positions are in a state of dynamic balance.
34...Qf7
35.Kg1 Rg7
36.Rh2 Qd7
A brilliant decision, based on an exceptionally profound understanding of the position. Geller takes on an endgame in which, despite his pawn minus, he can make Gligoric fight hard for the draw.
37.Qa8 Qd8
38.Qxd8 Bxd8
39.Ne3 Ra7
40.Be1 Nf6
Underscoring the weakness of White’s pawns at c4, d5 and e4. For once it turns out not to be such a good idea to put pawns on squares not controlled by one’s own bishop. As long as there are other pieces on the board, the pawns frequently get into difficulties.
41.Rb2 ...
41...Bc7
Despite the limited amount of material remaining, Black has dealt successfully with his main concern: keeping the white rook out of his back rank.
42.Kf1 Kf7
43.Ke2 Nxe4
Otherwise, the king gets to d3.
44.Nxg4 Kg6
45.Kd3 Ng5
46.Ne3 Ra3+
47.Ke2 Bd8
48.Bd2 e4
49.Rb8 ...
Gligoric has spent too much time pondering and waiting, while Black has, by his consistent play, strengthened his pieces’ positions to the maximum. Since White’s a- and g-pawns, though passed, are practically motionless, not surprisingly Black is in firm control of the initiative. White attempts to rectify his error by means of this rook incursion, and nearly succeeds.
49...Bf6
50.Ng4 Nf3
51.Nxf6 Kxf6
52.Bf4 Nd4+
53.Kf1 e3
White should not have allowed the black pawn to reach e3 so easily. 53.Kf2 was the proper move, and after 53...Rxa2+ 54.Kf1 Black could no longer play 54...e3; White would then have enough time to attack the pawn from the rear with Re8. The reason for keeping the e-pawn under restraint will become clear shortly.
54.Re8 e2+
55.Kf2 Rf3+
56.Kg2 Rf1
It seems quite likely that in his preliminary calculations Gligoric assumed that he need not fear this position, intending simply to take the e-pawn off with his rook (57.Rxe2). Only later did he notice that the reply to this would be, not 57...Nxe2, but 57...Rxf4.
57.Bd2 Rd1
58.Bc3 Rc1
59.Bxd4+ ...
The final error: he should not have traded his bishop. White now rids himself of the pawn at e2, but the d-pawn becomes still more dangerous. If the bishop had simply moved back and forth along the diagonal, I do not see how Black could have won. For example: 59.Bd2 Rd1 60.Ba5, or 59...Rxc4 60.Kf2 Rc2 61.Be1 Rxa2 62.Bc3.
59...cxd4
60.Rxe2 d3
61.Rf2+ Ke5
62.Kf3 Kd4
This pawn, with support of rook and king, will cost White his rook in a move or two.
63.g4 ...
White remembers his own passed pawns too late.
63...Kc3
64.Ke4 Re1+
65.Kf5 d2
66.Rxd2 Kxd2
67.g5 Kd3
68.c5 dxc5
69.d6 Re8
70.d7 Ra8
WHITE RESIGNED
A textbook rook-vs-separated-passed-pawns position. White is one move short of a draw: 71.Ke6 c4 72.Ke7 c3 73.d8=Q Rxd8 74.Kxd8 c2 75.g6 c1=Q 76.g7 Qg1.
181. Bronstein—Smyslov
(Ruy Lopez)
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Bxc6
One of World Champion Dr. Emanuel Lasker’s favorite variations; he employed it at the St. Petersburg tournament of 1914 to score a famous victory over Capablanca. Since then, Black’s defensive strategies have been worked out to the tiniest details; consequently, this variation is seldom employed any more, and is considered drawish.
4...dxc6 5.Nc3 f6 6.d4 exd4 7.Qxd4 Qxd4 8.Nxd4 Bd7 9.Be3 0-0-0 10.0-0-0 Ne7 11.h3 Ng6 12.Nb3 Bb4 13.Ne2 Rhe8 14.a3 Bf8 15.Nc3 Be6 16.Rxd8+ Rxd8 17.Rd1 Rxd1+ 18.Kxd1 Ne5 19.Bc5 Bd6 20.Bxd6 cxd6 21.Nd4
DRAW
182. Reshevsky—Keres
(Nimzoindian Defense)
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3 b6 5.Ne2 Ba6 6.Ng3
Now the pawn threatens to run from e3 up to e5, which Black cannot prevent by 6...d5 because of 7.Qa4+. Keres takes an interesting, though not an outstandingly good, decision: he allows the pawn to advance, and then counterattacks on d4.
6...0-0 7.e4 d6 8.Bd2 c5 9.a3 Ba5
Wrong: he should have taken on c3 without further ado, following this up with 10...Nc6.
10.d5 exd5 11.cxd5 Bxf1 12.Kxf1 Nbd7 13.h4 Re8 14.f3
DRAW
If the reader ever has such a position with White, he should never accept a draw; and if he has Black, he should never offer one. White has the better position. He may attack as he chooses, on either flank, with good prospects in either case. So why did Reshevsky offer a draw? Obviously, he was making his own calculations: there remained three rounds, with no chance for him to take first, and second place now seemed assured. Perhaps psychology had something to do with it, too, as well as arithmetic: after all, the three previous rounds had brought him only one half-point...
ROUND TWENTY-SEVEN
183. Keres—Bronstein
(King’s Indian)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 g6
3.Nc3 Bg7
4.e4 d6
5.f4 ...
The Four Pawns’ Attack. This variation has an interesting history. When it first appeared, it struck terror into the hearts of King’s Indian players. By the aggregate efforts of many masters, this attack’s steamroller tendencies were neutralized, and soon it was Black who began to score the points. The variation disappeared for quite some time, giving place to the more conservative setups with g2-g3 and Bg2, etc., or the “riskier” attack with 5.f2-f3, 6.Be3 and 7.Qd2.
Recently, the storming variation has reappeared, with new aspirations and new goals, of course, and decked out with an array of modern positional ideas.
In this game Black employs a thirty-year-old defensive line recommended by Alekhine. Not surprisingly, the line has gone stale since his day, and Black saves himself only by calling a timely halt to, and making some alterations in, his originally intended plan.
5...c5
6.dxc5 ...
This pawn used to be pushed to d5, but praxis has shown the line 6.d5 0-0 7.Nf3 e6 8.Bd3 exd5 9.cxd5 b5 to be acceptable for Black.
6...Qa5
7.Bd3 Qxc5
8.Nf3 ...
This is how the variation is played nowadays. White has good play for his pieces; unless he is prevented, he will not find it too difficult to put together a decisive mating attack.
8...0-0
9.Qe2 Nc6
10.Be3 Qh5
The queen went to the kingside in order to attack the bishop, in the event that White castles, with ...Ng4. The bishop could not retreat to d2 then, in view of 12...Nd4! (using the well-known technique of decoying both the queen and the knight from the defense of h2). However, White does have a better move.
11.h3 Ng4
12.Bd2! ...
Now Black must beat a sad retreat, so as not to suffer a worse fate. From the course indicated by his 10...Qh5 and his 11...Ng4, one might logically expect 12...Nd4 here, but then the well-considered 13.Qf1! would set Black insoluble problems.
Black’s defensive system has failed to justify itself.
12...Nf6
13.0-0 Nd7
Having suffered a fiasco on the kingside, Black’s knight journeys to the queenside. Black must be very careful, continuously calculating all the variations beginning with f4-f5, since his queen at h5 makes a very tempting target for the white minor pieces.
14.Rad1 Qa5
15.Bb1 Qb4
White straightforwardly improves his position, and Black, who has lost a great deal of time on the maneuver ...Qa5-h5-a5, is finding it most difficult to come up with a plan of equal value. The queenside diversion he undertakes places his queen in jeopardy once again, but it turns out to be the only means of maintaining the balance. 15...Qb4 is indeed the thread which holds Black’s game together.
16.Be3 ...
Now comes rapid simplification.
16...Nb6
17.Nd5 Qxb2
18.Qxb2 Bxb2
19.Nxb6 axb6

King’s Indian players will have to find a better antidote to the Four Pawns’ Attack.
184. Smyslov·—Gligoric
(King’s Indian)
1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 g6 3.Bf4
Two points in front of his nearest rivals, Smyslov employs quiet, solid lines for his last games, and does not avoid a draw, whether he has White or Black. For this game, he employs, once again, the variation he used in Game 139 against Boleslavsky.
3...Bg7 4.Nbd2 d6 5.h3 0-0 6.e3 c5 7.Be2 Nc6 8.Bh2 b6 9.0-0 Bb7 10.c3 Qd7 11.Re1 Rfd8 12.Qc2 Rac8 13.Rad1 cxd4 14.Nxd4 d5 15.Nxc6 Qxc6 16.Qb3 Qc5 17.Qb5
This is the sort of position where it is very difficult to create any kind of complications.
17...Qxb5 18.Bxb5 Ne8 19.Bd3 Nd6 20.f3 Bh6 21.Bf4
DRAW
185. Geller—Taimanov
(Ruy Lopez)
Why is it that today — as compared to ten years ago, let’s say — so few masters will go in for fierce combinative attacks, with piece sacrifices? More than any other reason, it is because the art of combinative defense these days has reached such a high level that in the heat of the battle it occasionally becomes difficult to determine who is attacking whom. Of course it’s fun to crumble the defenses of an opponent’s king move by move, to create irresistible threats, and to wind up the game with a mating attack. But how sad it can be to end up minus both piece and attack, to sit and wonder:” How did all this happen? Where did I go wrong?”
This is, roughly, the psychological backdrop of the Geller-Taimanov game; but at the very end, fortune favored the brave.
1.e4 e5
2.Nf3 Nc6
3.Bb5 Bb4
In the Evans Gambit, White sacrifices a pawn in order to lure the black bishop to b4, so that he can play c2-c3 and d2-d4 with tempo. Here the bishop is going to b4 of its own accord, and White can carry out the same idea free of charge, so to speak. Geller comes to an unexpected conclusion: since he is not required to sacrifice one of his own pawns, he takes one of his opponent’s.
4.0-0 Nge7
5.c3 Ba5
6.Bxc6 Nxc6
7.b4 Bb6
8.b5 Na5
9.Nxe5 0-0
10.d4 d5
I would prefer 10...Qe8, intending 11...d6.
11.Ba3 Re8
12.Qh5 ...
White has decided to sacrifice a piece for the attack. Naturally, he has plenty of grounds for this: the black king’s knight has been driven to a5, and the bishop at b6 is also out of play. And the combined force of the bishop at a3, the rook on the f-file, and the queen bodes nothing good for Black’s king. Nevertheless, 12.Nd2 first was better, since complete success will never be attainable without this knight.
12...f6
13.f4 ...
The further course of the game will demonstrate that this move should have lost by force.
13...fxe5
14.fxe5 Be6
The main line of Geller’s combination ran as follows: 14...Nc4 15.Qf7+ Kh8 16.Bf8, forcing mate. It was not his fault that Taimanov’s sharp eye spotted and neutralized this combination. On the other hand, White still has quite a few attacking possibilities.
15.Nd2 dxe4
16.Nxe4 Bxd4+
A powerful positional move that brings Black’s bishop into the game. The fact that a pawn is also gained, and with check at that, is mere circumstance.
17.Kh1 ...
After 17.cxd4 Qxd4+ 18.Nf2 Nc4, White’s attack would come to a swift and bitter conclusion. Now 17...Bxe5 would run into 18.Ng5, while after 17...Be3, the rook occupies the d-file-with tempo (18.Rad1), creating boundless possibilities for the attacker’s fantasy involving 19.Rf3 or 19.Rd3.
Once again, Taimanov finds the best move.
17...Bd5
18.Nf6+ ...
Another sacrifice; this one is forced, since the knight hasn’t the time to retreat.
18...gxf6
19.cxd4 Qd7
This is enough for a defense, but bringing up the reserves with 19...Nc4 was better.
20.exf6 Qf7
21.Rf5 ...
White must submit to this exchange of queens and continue the fight with his two pawns against Black’s piece.
21...Qxh5
22.Rxh5 Bf7
23.Rg5+ Bg6
24.Be7 Kf7
25.Rc1 Rac8
26.h4 Rg8
Having successfully carried off his complex defensive task and achieved a winning position, Taimanov begins to play carelessly. Here the enemy pawn ought to have been stopped with 26...h5; if then 27.g4 hxg4 28.h5 Rh8.
27.Re5 b6
28.g4 Bd3
29.g5 Rge8
Another inaccuracy. 29...Nc4 30.R5e1 Nd6 was necessary.
30.Rc3 Bc4
The last mistake. He could have held on with 30...Bg6.
31.Rg3 c6
32.h5 Rg8
33.Bb4 Rce8
34.Rge3 Rxe5
35.Rxe5 Be6
36.Bxa5 bxa5
37.bxc6 Rd8
38.c7 Rc8
39.d5 Bg4
40.Re7+ Kf8
41.g6 hxg6
42.hxg6
BLACK RESIGNED
Worth noting is Geller’s fierce determination in seeking every chance available to him in the two-pawns-vs-piece endgame. Following his Round 24 draw with Reshevsky, Geller won three in a row, and in the next round he was to add a fourth — the longest winning streak of the tournament. This brilliant finish assured Geller of a good place after his disastrous start.
186. Kotov—Najdorf
(King’s Indian)
1.c4 Nf6
2.Nc3 g6
3.d4 Bg7
4.e4 d6
5.f3 0-0
6.Be3 e5
7.d5 c5
8.g4
After his unhappy experience with the opening as White in Game 171, Kotov - Gligoric, in which he played 8.Bd3, Kotov switches to the more aggressive continuation 8.g2-g4 and 9.h2-h4, intending to break down the black king’s fortress at once.
8...Ne8
9.h4 f5
10.exf5 gxf5
11.g5 e4
12.f4 ...
The advantage of advancing this pawn to f4 is that Black’s pieces are denied the square e5. On the other hand, this move also has serious drawbacks: Black obtains a protected passed pawn in the center, the darksquare bishop is blocked, and white’s knight loses the f4 square.
Ng1-h3-f4, creating the ever-present threat of sinking the knight at e6 and also of a possible excursion to h5, was much better.
12...b5
13.cxb5 a6
Encouraged by his preponderance in the center, Najdorf undertakes a powerful wing demonstration.
14.Qd2 axb5
15.Bxb5 Ba6
16.Bxa6 Nxa6
17.Nge2 ...
The threat of ...Na6-b4-d3+ forces White to castle hurriedly on the short side, which means that his main strategic idea — an attack on the kingside — has come a cropper. Now his whole game looks dubious. Black’s queen can travel the Great White Way, f7-h5-g4, to approach the exposed white king, the d5-pawn looks very lonely indeed, and the white bishop has no prospects. In such a position, an extra pawn is small consolation.
17...Nb4
18.0-0 Nc7
19.Nc1 Qe8
20.a3 Qh5
A pretty maneuver. Najdorf’s threat of ...Qg4+ and ...Qxh4+ brings the white rook to f2. White is willing to give up the h-pawn without a check, but Najdorf has other ideas.
21.Rf2 Qf7
And here’s the idea! Now the rook can no longer reach d1, so the d-pawn is defenseless. And with the d5 outpost gone, Black advances his pawn from d6 to d4, and the game will end almost instantly. Naturally, Kotov objects to such an immediate and painful end; so with his usual defensive resourcefulness, he gives up an exchange for a pawn, casting the game into a sea of interesting complications. Najdorf, who probably thought his win would now be a matter of technique, must begin the fight all over again. Psychologically, this is sometimes very difficult.
22.axb4 Rxa1
23.bxc5 dxc5
The first inaccuracy. There was a fairly simple win after 23...Bxc3 24.bxc3 Nxd5 25.cxd6 Nxe3 26.Qxe3 Qd5, but who likes to give away his “Indian” bishop?
24.Bxc5 Rd8
25.d6 ...
25...Ne8
A second inaccuracy, and this one probably costs him the win. After 25...Ne6 26.Bb6 Rd7 27.Rf1 Ra6, White would lose his passed pawn without getting any counter-chances in return for it. The text move looks stronger, but it allows Kotov an amazing resource later on.
26.Kg2 Bf8
27.N1e2 Nxd6
28.Qd5 Nb7
29.Qxf7+ Kxf7
30.Bxf8 Rxf8
31.Ng3 Nd6
Had Najdorf foreseen white’s idea, he might have played 31...Ke6, followed by ...Nc5-d3; however, fully confident that this position was an automatic win, he continued his incautious play..
32.Rd2 Ke6
33.Rd5 Rb8
And now Najdorf is ready to reap the harvest. First he will pick up the pawn at b2; then his rooks will put the squeeze on White’s knights; then the e-pawn will go on to queen — but as the Eastern proverb has it:” If it weren’t for the wolves, our goat could make it to Mecca.” But now two howling wolves appear, in the form of a pair of white knights...
We should point out that in the diagrammed position 34.Nxf5 Nxf5 35.Re5+ Kd7 36.Rxf5 fails to 36...Rxb2+ 37.Kg3 Rb3. Black could also take the b-pawn at once with 34...Rxb2+ 35.Kh3 Nxf5 36.Re5 Kd7 37.Rxf5 Ra3.
34.Rxd6+! Kxd6
35.Nxf5+ Kc6
36.Nxe4 Rxb2+
37.Kf3 Rb4
38.Nfg3 Raa4
39.h5 Ra3+
Najdorf’s chief difficulty is that he is not sure whether he ought to be playing for the win or giving thought to saving the game. At any moment, one of the knights may come up with a fatal fork, so he keeps his rooks at a respectful distance.
40.Kg4 Kd7
41.g6 hxg6
42.hxg6 Ke7
43.Nf5+ Ke6
44.Ng7+ Ke7
45.Nf5+ Ke6
46.g7 Ra8
47.Neg3 Rg8
48.Nh5 Rxf4+
A fitting conclusion to a most interesting game! Where Kotov took a knight and a pawn for each of his rooks, Najdorf gets only a pair of pawns for his pair of rooks, leaving Kotov the knights as interest, so to speak. However, two knights cannot mate, as we know: they can only stalemate.
49.Kxf4 Rxg7
50.Nhxg7+
DRAW
This game might better belong in an adventure magazine than in a tournament book.
187. Boleslavsky—Petrosian
(Caro-Kann Defense)
1.e4 c6
2.Nc3 d5
3.d4 dxe4
4.Nxe4 Bf5
This is Black’s standard continuation in this opening. Although theory considers it completely sound, I have a weakness for the impudent 4...Nf6 5.Nxf6+ gxf6. If the reader who wishes to trap me in my words should ask why I never played this, even once, in the thirty rounds of this tournament, I would pick one reason out of many, and reply that nobody played i e2-e4, even once, against me.
5.Ng3 Bg6
6.Nh3 e6
7.Nf4 Bd6
8.c3 Nf6
9.h4 Qc7
Now White has the choice of 10.Qf3, stirring up interesting double-edged complications such as 10...Nbd7 11.h5 Bc2 12.h6 g6 13.Bc4 e5 14.Qe2 0-0-0; or 10.h5, which sacrifices a pawn, but leaves Black with a permanent weakness at e6. Boleslavsky chooses the second, and better, continuation.
10.h5 Bxf4
11.Bxf4 Qxf4

A curious decision: White offers to exchange queens, even though he is a pawn down! Petrosian may have entertained the hope that Boleslavsky would yield to the temptation to play 13.Qb3, hitting b7 and e6 simultaneously; the text destroys his illusions (13.Qb3 Ng4 14.Qxe6+ Kd8).

II. 29...Bxe5 30.dxe5 Nxc4 31.exd6 Nxd6 32.Bxg7, and although the pawns are still even, Black’s game is lost, since he cannot stop White from creating a passed pawn on the h-file.
Averbakh finds the best defense, comparatively speaking.
30.Bxa5
He could have taken the g6-pawn with his knight (30.Nxg6), but after 30...Nxc4 31.Bb4 Black could sacrifice a piece with 31...a3! 32.Rxc4 axb2 33.Rb3 Rxa2, muddying the waters, considerably. Stahl-berg’s choice is more conservative.

40...Re4
This is completely worthless. The pawn should have been attacked with 40...Rb6; the continuation 41.Rxe6 Rxe6 42.Rxe6 Rxb2 leaves Black some hope, at least.

20.bxc4 Nd4
The black pawn at d4 is doomed, but the c-file will be opened, and the pawn at c4 will also be a target for sundry assaults. It would be very tempting to put his knight on a3 (20...Na3): after 21.Bxa3 bxa3 Black would control the important square b2 — but not for long, since 22.Qa4 would attack the pawn and the bishop at a6. So the knight takes the other path. As regards so-called “doomed” pawns, we know — from Game 87, for instance — that sometimes they can prove to be very hardy indeed. In this game too, despite all the bloodletting that follows, the d4-pawn manages to outlive many.
21.Nxd4 cxd4
22.Bf1 Rc8
23.Bd3 ...
The bishop stands well here: it defends the c- and e-pawns, and prevents the enemy pawn from advancing. Now White may consider besieging that pawn.
23...Qb6
24.Qb3 ...
Black’s previous move stepped up the pressure on the c-pawn. 24.Qa4 would have been wrong, therefore, in view of 24...Bxc4 25.Bxc4 d3+ 26.Kg2 d2 27.Red1 Bxb2, when the White position is in ruins.

From the diagram, one might find it hard to believe that there might be a chink in White’s position, and especially that it might be at d5, which appears to be his strongest point, resting as it does on two firm pillars and immune to pawn attack. In this position, however, a combinative motif appears: by means of a series of exchanges, Black draws both of White’s rooks away from the defense of his queen’s bishop, and then the c-pawn, which covers this bishop on the file, can no longer play’ its role as defender of the d-pawn.

A quick look at the new grouping of Black’s pieces reveals a curious picture: the queen has taken the place of the king, and the bishop, the queen’s. It is a typical deployment in these positions where Black prepares for ...e6-e5.
11.Ne1 e5
12.e3 Bd7
13.Nc2 exd4
Averbakh’s insipid play has allowed Black the chance to mount a successful kingside attack. Black intended a pawn sacrifice here: 14.exd4 f4!, opening the queen’s bishop’s diagonal. Deciding that this would be a dangerous line, White recaptures with his knight, despite the temptation to open the e-file for his pieces.
14.Nxd4 Nxd4
15.Bxd4 Bc6
By bringing this bishop out to an active position, and then obtaining his opponent’s consent to its exchange, Boleslavsky scores a weighty positional success. In the Dutch Defense, Black’s lightsquare bishop is considered bad (especially in the Stonewall Variation), while White’s fianchettoed king’s bishop is the mainstay of his position. The exchange of these bishops creates an unpleasant situation around the white king.

193. Najdorf—Geller
(King’s Indian)
This game was identical to the Najdorf - Petrosian game until move 12: again, Najdorf gave up his central pawn for the black b-pawn, and thereby abandoned the struggle to solve one of the basic problems of the opening. But where Petrosian, in the sixth-round game alluded to, immediately committed a serious positional error by playing ...c7-c5 and deprived his knight of its best square, Geller takes a lesson from that game, and carries out a successful queenside attack here.

14.Qe2 Ne5!
In some openings — Alekhine’s Defense, for example, or the Grunfeld — Black moves an unprotected piece into the center to induce the hypertrophied advance of White’s pawns, intending to attack them later. Geller here executes a similar idea in the middlegame. He is trying to induce White’s pawns to advance to f4 and to b3, which he soon accomplishes. Later, he will work up an attack against the pawn at b3, for which purpose he will set his rooks on the b-file and his knight at c5, supporting the a-pawn’s advance to a4. The reader should note that Petrosian was unable to carry out the same idea only because he had no piece that could control the a4 square: the queen, of course, is not a proper piece for this purpose, and the knight needs the square c5 — which, as we saw, had been occupied by his pawn.
15.f4 Nd7
16.Nd5 Rb8
Despite the white knight’s threatening posture, and the rather humble status of Black’s pawns, we consider Black’s position preferable. The knight will not keep its place on d5 for very long, while Black’s pawns harbor a great deal of potential energy. White will have trouble developing his rooks, and his wing attack on the kingside has fewer prospects than Black’s attack on the queen-side.

23...Bxc3
24.Nxc3 Qa6
The strategic idea is proper; its tactical execution is faulty. The weakening 25.b3 could also have been induced by 24...Qb4, and the queen would have been much more actively placed.
25.b3 Rb6
26.Ne4 Nxe4
27.Qxe4 Re8
Black is going to extremes in his effort to avoid the advance of his center pawns. This was exactly the proper moment to answer white’s flank attack, in accordance with classical principles, with a counterstroke in the center: 27...e6! 28.g4 d5; now white’s first attacking wave has been beaten off, and the black pawn cannot be prevented from advancing to a4.
28.f5 Ne5
29.f6! Qa7
Now it becomes clear that in his singleminded pursuit of his queenside idea Black has neglected his chances in the center, thereby handing over the initiative to his opponent.
30.Rbd1 Rb4
This could have led to serious difficulties. 30...Qc7 was necessary, to defend the d-pawn.
31.Qd4 c5
Trading queens would correct White’s pawn structure, and cost Black his c-pawn and the game.
32.Qh4 ...
White’s goal would have been attained with 32.Qf4, with the same idea of penetrating to h6, but without losing sight of the knight on e5, and maintaining pressure on the pawn at d6. Then Black would have had to turn his entire attention to defense, whereas now he succeeds in carrying out his plan of breaking into the White position through b3.

Any queen retreat would have allowed 9...c7-c5, when Black has solved the two basic problems of the Catalan: the development of his queen’s bishop, and counterattacking the pawn at d4. After the exchange of queens, further simplifications quickly follow, and the game winds up drawn. One must conclude, then, that the queen’s meanderings from d1 to a4 to c4 and back to a4 again, in search of the sacrificed pawn, were absolutely harmless to Black.
Rapid development of White’s kingside (5.Nf3) holds out more promise. The c4-pawn would not run away, and Black could not try to hold on to it without creating weaknesses in his position.

Five pawn moves in a row! Strictly speaking, one should never play like this, but here the white pawns’ inchworm progression is justified by the introverted character of the position. White wants to kill three birds with one stone, putting Black’s knights under threat of a pawn press, giving his bishop an exit to g5, and simultaneously closing off the fianchettoed black queen’s bishop’s diagona1.
However, all of these White achievements would pale to insignificance if Black would recall his own chances, particularly against the chronically sick pawn at c4.
So we can see that both sides are entering the middlegame with roughly even chances: everything turns on which player handles his pieces better.

A powerful move. White wished to take at f6 with his bishop, and then to play his knight out to h5. Black does not object to this turn of events, but he wishes to introduce a small but substantial change: 15...h5. Now the knight can only reach h5 by capturing this pawn, and this small detail changes the picture completely: after White plays Nxh5, Black will have two attacking lines, instead of one.

The merits of Black’s plan maybe seen in the thematic variation 20.exf5 Rxh5 21.Qxh5 Qxg2 mate. If Black had left his pawn at h7, the white knight at h5 would have been unassailable. All this was very nicely played by Keres.

A knight usually stands well at e5. Gligoric’s attempt to centralize his rook could have resulted in an immediate loss. However, saying that White committed an oversight is about the same as saying nothing at all; it is a great deal more interesting to speculate on the causes of White’s oversight. During a lengthy war of maneuver, it not infrequently happens that one’s combinative alertness is dulled. I think that this is precisely what happened here, to both players.
33...Qf7
This is not like Keres; in such cases, the commentator generally justifies the oversight with time-pressure”. By trapping the rook with 33...Ne4, Black could have either forced 34.Rxe4 or captured the knight on g3, since the knight (34.Nf1) could not leave that square in view of the obvious combination 34...Rxg2+! 35.Kxg2 Qxh5.

The queen finds a roundabout route behind white’s pawns. White has dug himself in thoroughly, but Black’s advantage is of a lasting sort, expressed less in the activity of his pieces than in his better pawn position. Specifically:
a) all of Black’s pawns form a single strand, while White’s are broken into three “islands”, to use Botvinnik’s expression;
b) the pawns at d5 and f5 secure e4 for Black’s knight; if White should trade knights on that square, Black gets a protected passed pawn;
c) if Black wins the a-pawn, his passed a-pawn will queen without opposition; the “ready-made” passed h-pawn cannot do this, since the white pieces are unable to clear its path.
These are the major features of the position, and they serve to explain why Black is constantly on the offensive, while White can only defend himself passively. Under the circumstances, White’s defense must crack sooner or later.

18.g3 ...
Up to and including Black’s 17th move, this variation is well-known to theory. Here 18.g4 Nf4 19.Bxf4 exf4 20.e5 is recommended, and White wins a pawn due to his threat of 21.Qe4. Theory needs only a pawn ahead to come up with its ±, but that’s not quite enough for the chessplayer sitting at the board. It is frequently possible to win a pawn with such moves as g2-g4 or ...g7-g5, but how then does one convert that pawn into a full point?
In this instance, is 18.g4 justifiable? I think not. After 18.g4 Nf4 19.Bxf4 exf4 20.e5, for example, Black could play 20...Bb7 21.Qe4 g6, and if 22.Qxf4 f6, when the game opens up in a manner clearly favorable to Black, who is always assured of at least a draw.
Such were the considerations by which I came gradually to the conclusion that 18.g4 was not the move. However, I could not allow a knight on f4, either. Thus arose the move 18.g3; so far as my memory serves, this has never before appeared in a-tournament game.
Black, of course, cannot take the h-pawn (18...Bxh3), since after 19.Ng5 White wins in all lines: the bishop at h3 and the knight at h5 are both

.

White tries to open the position as much as possible; this will make the advantage of his two bishops more tangible. Black seeks the reverse: to keep his defense at least semi-closed.
26...Nf6
27.Ng5 ...
Black was ready to play 27...e4 and bring his rook over to h5.
White has not yet forgotten the golden rule: Always combine attack with defense. Unfortunately, he did forget this rule later.
27...Nd8
28.bxc4 Qxc4
29.Qxc4 bxc4
30.Ra4 Nd7
31.Rxc4 Nc5
Black’s pieces are now so well posted that White’s rook can find no way to penetrate. Still, White has achieved something: he has created a passed pawn (although it is not far advanced), which in conjunction with his two bishops represents a force to be reckoned with.
32.Ne4 Nde6
33.Nxc5 Nxc5
34.Rb4 Nd3
Just as White feared, the knight has reached d3. However, now the white rook reaches the eighth rank as well, and gives the game’s first check.
35.Rb8+ Kg7
36.Be3 e4
37.Re8 Bf6
38.Rc8 ...
In terrific time-pressure, White declined to play 38.c4 in view of 38...Rf5, failing to see that after 39.Rxe4 Nxf2 40.Rf4! the knight would be trapped. The proper reply for Black would be 38...Re5, when White could hardly have hoped to exploit his minimal advantage.
38...Nxf2
Unexpected, and quite pretty. If the knight is taken — which is what White should have done — the rook goes to the second rank and picks up one of White’s bishops. Striving for a win at all costs, White rejected this variation in favor of a subtle trap; then, holding his breath, he waited to see if Reshevsky would fall into it.
39.c4 Ra5
40.Bb3 Ra3
Black is absolutely determined to attack two bishops simultaneously. With this move — while I was still writing it down, in fact — Reshevsky offered a draw (for the third time this game).
41.Bc5 Be7
41...Rxb3? 42.Bf8+ Kh8 43.Bh6+ Bd8 44.Rxd8 mate.
Threatening mate after 42.Bf8+. The rest is understandable: White wins the exchange, and the game with it.

This pawn will shortly cost Black his bishop.

ROUND TWENTY-NINE
197. Reshevsky—Gligoric
(King’s Indian)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 g6
3.g3 Bg7
4.Bg2 0-0
5.Nc3 d6
6.Nf3 c5
We are indebted to the Yugoslavs for the introduction of this move to serious international practice. White has to decide here whether to push his pawn to d5 or allow the black knight to develop to c6 and then drive it at once to a5. In either event, the game will be very interesting. Of course, White’s opening advantage will not be neutralized immediately, but Black has no need to fear: although White does stand a bit more actively, Black still disposes of sufficient possibilities for the most diverse creative efforts.
Among Soviet players, the Leningrad grandmaster Korchnoi is a virtuoso in this variation.
7.d5 Na6
8.Nd2 Nc7
9.Qc2 Rb8
10.b3 ...
Reshevsky copies Euwe’s play in the latter’s game with Szabo. I do not think it proper to allow Black to get in ...b7-b5 so easily: 9.a4 might have been played, even though this weakens the b4 square — but how important is that, if Black cannot extract anything from it? On the other hand, Reshevsky had played just that move some days earlier against Boleslavsky. And although he obtained an advantage there, he tries for more here — and winds up with nothing!
10...b5
11.Bb2 bxc4
12.Nxc4 ...
If this knight had a chance of reaching c6 later, then this recapture would be justified. But since the variation 12...Ba6 13.Na5 N7xd5 14.Nc6 Nb4 is in Black’s favor, the pawn recapture would have made more sense: d5 and b5 would have been more solidly defended, and the rook on b1 would have turned out to be well placed after all.
12...Ba6
13.Ne3 Rb4
14.0-0 Qd7
15.h3 Rfb8
16.Rab1 Qc8
17.Kh2 Nce8
Black obtained a very good game out of the opening, but he is totally incapable of deciding which side is the better one from which to begin his assault on the d5-pawn; thus he continues to shuffle his pieces back and forth. This sort of cat-and-mouse play allows Reshevsky time for a singularly favorable regrouping, and then White can give his opponent a little trouble too. Gligoric ought to have picked out a proper time to bring his knight from c7 to d4; instead, he drops it back to e8 for some unknown reason, only to bring it back out again.
18.Ba3 R4b7
19.Rfc1 Qd8
20.Na4 Nd7
21.Be4 ...
White wants to trade off the hampering black queen’s bishop. In such positions, I like the break with a2-a3 and b3-b4.
21...Nc7
22.Bb2 Nf6
23.Bd3 Bh6
Gligoric unexpectedly loses his patience, and comes up with a very dangerous plan to open the game with ...e7-e6 — dangerous because, while the e-file does fall into Black’s hands, the combination of ...Bh6 and ...e7-e6 hands White the important diagonal a1-h8 and the key square f6. Later, Reshevsky takes faultless advantage of this “generosity”.
24.f4 Qd7
25.Nc3 e6
26.Ne4 ...
The refutation of Black’s idea. It’s a real shame that the d-pawn is now attacked three times, not even defended once— and yet it cannot be taken.
26...Nxe4
White threatened simultaneous check to the queen and the king, so the knight had to be removed. Other lines would lead to still greater advantage for White, for instance: 26...Nfe8 27.Qc3 Bg7 28.Qxg7+ Nxg7 29.Nf6+, or 26...Nfxd5 27.Nxd5 Bxd3 28.Ndf6+, or, finally, 26...Nfe8 27.Qc3 e5 28.fxe5 Bxe3 29.e6.
27.Bxe4 f5
28.dxe6 Qxe6
29.Bxb7 Rxb7
Recapturing with the bishop (29...Bxb7) would do little to improve Gligoric’s position, since after 30.Qc4 Nd5 31.Ng2, followed by 32.Rd1, Black’s attack would soon run out.
30.Qc3 Ne8
31.Qd2 ...
In time-pressure, Reshevsky could not bring himself to try the forcing line, although Black’s resistance would have been speedily crushed after 31.Qh8+ Kf7 32.Qxh7+ Bg7 33.Bxg7 Nxg7 34.Rc3 d5 35.Ng2. Now, Black gets drawing chances.

The last error in time-pressure: he should have... taken off the. knight at f6 (37...Nxf6), retreated his rook to e6, and tried to get his bishop to e4, after which the battle might have begun afresh. White would still have won with 38.Rxd6, sacrificing two pieces for a rook, but activating his own pieces to the maximum: 38...Ne4 39.Rxa6 Nd2 40.Rc1 Nf3+ 41.Kf1 Rxb2 42.Rxc5, or 38...Bb7 39.Bxf6 Rg2+ 40.Kf1 Rxg3 41.Rd8+ Kf7 42.Be5: here there would have been some practical chances, whereas now the game is over.

Sozin’s sharp system, which we have already seen. Theoretical opinion concerning this variation has changed more than once.
It was played three times in the Zurich tournament; today it is the favorite weapon of young Robert Fischer.
6...e6
7.0-0 a6
8.Be3 Qc7
9.Bb3 Na5
In Game 146 Taimanov played 9...Be7 here against Averbakh, and lost. Now he returns to the older system with 9...Na5, so as to be sooner rid of that pernicious bishop. Later, once he had rehabilitated 9...Be7, Taimanov used it successfully in one of his games at the XXI USSR Championship.
10.f4 b5
11.f5 ...
An old idea in a new setting. In the final round of the 1935 Moscow International Tournament, the 67-year-old Emanuel Lasker destroyed Pirc’s position right out of the opening with a similar all-out attack, and received a brilliancy prize for his play. Keres carries out a similar idea, but he is not following Lasker so much as Tolush, who also employed 11.f5, not too long before this tournament, in his game with Taimanov in the Leningrad Championship that year.
11...Nxb3
12.cxb3 Be7
One of the positional rules — capture toward the center—is being broken frequently of late. In this position, the idea is clear: to open the c-file for the white rooks. However, in the endgame, the disadvantages of his pawn structure could cause White considerable embarrassment.
Black must exercise some caution in completing his development. Such moves as 12...b4, or 12...e5, followed by 13...b4, may win the e-pawn, it is true; but they contradict Black’s strategy.
13.Rc1 Qd7
Here is Taimanov’s prepared improvement. The continuation in the Tolush - Taimanov game alluded to was 13...Qb7 14.b4 0-0 15.fxe6 fxe6 16.Qb3, with some pressure; here Black covers e6 with two pieces, and then quietly castles.
14.fxe6 fxe6
15.b4 0-0
16.Qb3 ...
A rare place for the queen in the Sicilian. Keres hopes either to induce ...d6-d5, or else to pin Black’s bishop down to c8. Taimanov finds still another solution: he prepares ...e6-e5.
16...Kh8
Black does not wish to become active too soon, while his king is still exposed. Indeed, after 16...Ng4 White has the pretty stroke 17.Nd5, when Black would be in some difficulty.
17.h3 e5
Combinations can be part of the defense, as well as the attack. Here we see the start of a combination whose final goal is to wrest away the initiative from his opponent.
18.Nf5
18.Nc6? would be a mistake in view of 18...Qxc6 19.Nd5 Qe8 20.Nc7 Qg6 21.Nxa8 Bxh3.
18...Bb7
19.Nxe7 ...
White must begin this series of exchanges, since retreating to g3 would mean going on the defensive.
Keres may have hoped he would have the time to secure d5 by means of 19.Bg5, followed by 20.Bxf6; only now did he notice that 19.Bg5 loses a pawn after 19...Nxe4 20.Nxe7 Nxg5 or 20.Bxe7 Rxf5. So White takes the bishop first, and then plays Bg5. And to avoid finding himself in an inferior position, he shores up his e-pawn with a number of exchanges, attempting simultaneously to press his claim on the d-pawn.
19...Qxe7
20.Bg5 h6
21.Bxf6 Rxf6
22.Rxf6 Qxf6
23.Rf1 Qg6
White has made no obvious error, but nonetheless the initiative has gradually passed over to Black. It appears evident that attacking the e-pawn with 16.Qb3 took too much time, while not giving White any real chances. A different and more promising plan was adopted by Geller in his game against Taimanov from the XXI USSR Championship. Instead of opening the f-file with 14.fxe6, he played 14.Qf3, continuing his attack with g2-g4-g5. It would seem that somewhere along these lines the fate of Taimanov’s defense to 6.Bc4 will be decided.
In the meantime, however, Keres must find the simplest means of neutralizing Taimanov’s pressure in the difficult endgame that lies ahead. He decides to give up his e-pawn for Black’s d-pawn, and to retain the heavy pieces for play against the passed (and “almost extra”) e-pawn.
24.Qd1 Rc8
Black does not fear the white piece invasion of his eighth rank: after the e-pawn falls, it is White’s king which will be the first to come under a mating attack.
25.Qf3 Rc4
26.Rd1 Kh7
27.a3 Bxe4
Keres has managed to plug the holes in his position by means of some accurate play, and Taimanov can find nothing better than to go into a queen ending in which White has a useless doubled pawn on the queenside.
28.Nxe4 Rxe4
29.Rxd6 Re1+
30.Kf2 Qxd6
31.Kxe1 Qg6
32.Kd2 e4
33.Qf2 ...
A quick glance at this position might leave one wondering how even Keres, with all his skill in queen endings, could save this game. However, there are two peculiarities in this position which ease White’s task a bit: the black king’s scanty cover, which means White is always threatening a perpetual check, and the solid position of White’s queenside pawns— after all, they
are
three against two! The meaning of this latter circumstance will soon become clear.
33...Qg5+
33...Qf6 is useless, since White would bravely proceed to exchange queens (34.Qxf6 gxf6), continuing — not with 35.g4, certainly (which would be good after 35...Kg6 36.Ke3 f5, but would be refuted by 36...Kg5) — with 35.Ke3!, which forces 35...f5. After 36.g4, there would be very few chances left, it is true, but they’d all be White’s.
34.Ke2 Qd5
35.Ke3! ...
This saves the game. All of White’s pawns turn out to be placed precisely where they are needed. If it were not for the pawn at b4, 35...Qc5+ would win; the b2-pawn defends the a3-pawn, which would otherwise be lost to 35...Qd3+.
35...Qd3+
White threatened to attack the e-pawn with 36.Qc2, and 35...Kg6 fails to 36.Qc2 Kf5 37.Qc8+.
36.Kf4 g5+
37.Ke5!

Black’s wing-pawn push is a well-known technique used against pawns at a3, b4 and c4 (or the corresponding pawns at a6, b5 and c5). 18.bxa5 would have been met by 18...Nxa5, attacking the c-pawn down the file. Geller’s reply weakened the c5 square. Black’s knight heads for it immediately, forcing White to take it off next move. This helps, but only by half, since Black still has his other knight.
On 18.Qb3, White’s queen would remain tied to the defense of the b-pawn, a circumstance which Black could exploit by preparing a kingside attack. Nevertheless, he should not have weakened c5.

25.f4 e4
26.Nc2 Nc5
Complications such as 26...Qxc4 27.Nd4 Qf7 28.Qg3 Rg6 29.Rxc8+ Bxc8 30.Qh4 evidently appeared double-edged to Black, so Petrosian declined the sacrifice. White has passed the dangerous corner in safety, and now pulls confidently in for a drawn finish.

White wants to sacrifice a pawn for quick development. The present position offers little grounds to recommend such an experiment: Black is well developed, and his king solidly protected. 7.Bg5 would have led to some curious complications, for example: 7...Qa5 8.Bd2 Nc5 9.Qc2 Nce4! 10.Nxe4 Nxe4 11.Nb3 Bxd2+ 12.Nxd2 d5, and Black is more actively placed.
7...Ne4
8.Be2 Qa5
9.0-0 Nac5
This refutes white’s idea. If the bishop had taken on c3 at once (9...Bxc3), then White’s development after 10.bxc3 Qxc3 11.Bb2 would be full compensation for Black’s extra pawn. Nor would the trade of queens at b3 (11...Qxb3 12.axb3) have hurt White, since this would reunite the a-and c-pawns. But now the queen must move to c2, and the exchange will take place under circumstances unfavorable to White.
10.Qc2 Bxc3
11.bxc3 Qxc3

17...dxe5

19.g3 Nf6
The weakness at d4 can only be exploited in an ending; and, strictly speaking, now was the time to start thinking about exchanging queens. The variation 19...Qc5 20.Qxc5 Ndxc5 seems to meet the needs of the position, since the knight on d7 goes to c5, and the threat of the other knight to go to a4 would force White to keep a knight posted at c2 to guard that square. However, Reshevsky declined the queen trade, since after 20.b4 axb3 21.axb3 Qxf2+ 22.Kxf2 Black’s minimal advantage would not have been sufficient to win.
20.b4
This strong move equalizes the game completely; now f3-f4 is a threat. So Reshevsky was forced to accept the
DRAW
here. It seems to me that the American grandmaster committed his mistake even before the start of this game: he should have chosen a different variation, or perhaps even a different opening. The line that occurred in the game was too well known to Taimanov.

On 11.Nd2, Black could bravely proceed with 11...d5!, when White’s attempt to exploit the fork motif by 12.cxd5 cxd5 13.Nb5 would be met by 13...Re6 14.Qc7 Qe8. And on 11.Ng5, Black could sacrifice a pawn for good prospects with 11...e3, and if 12.Bxe3 Rxe3 13.fxe3 Ng4, or 12.fxe3 Ng4 at once, with good piece play.
11...Qe7
12.h3 a6
13.a4 d5
14.cxd5 cxd5
15.a5 b5
16.axb6 Nxb6
17.Qd2 Be6
18.Nc2 Qd7
19.Kh2 h5
20.Na4 Nxa4
21.Rxa4 Qc7
Black is now threatening ...h5-h4, so White retreats his king to g1.
22.Kg1 Reb8
23.Na1 Kh7
24.Qa2 Rb6
25.Bc-f4 Qd7
26.Kh2 Ne8
27.Rc1 Nd6
28.Bxd6 ...
Another achievement for Black, this one induced by his threat of 28...Nf5. The absence of this bishop makes itself felt later.
28...Qxd6
29.e3 h4
30.b4 ...
Boleslavsky’s attack has grown quite ominous. Euwe decides to sacrifice a pawn in the hope of distracting his opponent from his king long enough so that he can free himself a bit.
30...Bh6
31.Rc3 Rxb4
32.Nb3 Rxa4
33.Qxa4 Bd7
34.Qa5 Bb5
The lightsquare bishop, having sat for so long in reserve, now enters the fray.
35.Nc5 Rb8
36.Qa1 Bg5
37.Qd1 hxg3+
38.fxg3 f5
39.Qe1 Bc4
40.Kg1 Bd8
Now the other bishop also joins in the attack, heading for c7, where it supports the queen in its activities along the diagonal b8-h2. Boleslavsky plays this phase of the game with great skill.
41.Rc2 Bc7
42.Bf1 ...
Euwe offers Black his g-pawn in exchange for the a-pawn, hoping to get the queens exchanged and thereby relieve himself of worrying over mate threats.
On 42.Kh2, Black had the elegant rook sacrifice 42...Rb1 43.Qxb1 Qxg3+ 44.Kg1 Qh2+. addition to this threat to invade on the b-file with his rook, Black also had the simpler plan ...g6-g5 and ...f5-f4, so White’s position must be untenable.
42...Bxf1
Black could have brought his other bishop decisively into the game here by 42...Ba5 43.Qxa5 (43.Qf2 Rb1) 43...Qxg3+ 44.Rg2 Qxe3+ 45.Kh1 Rb1 46.Qc7+ Kh6 47.Ne6 Qxh3+!
43.Kxf1 Qxg3
44.Qxg3 Bxg3
45.Nxa6 Rb3
46.Ke2 g5
47.Nc5 Rb6
48.Ra2 f4
49.Ra7+ Kg6
50.Ra6 f3+
51.Kf1 Rxa6
52.Nxa6 Bd6
This is why the bishop is stronger than the knight.
53.Kf2 Kf7
WHITE RESIGNED
208. Gligoric—Bronstein
(Nimzoindian Defense)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6
3.Nc3 Bb4
4.e3 0-0
5.Ne2 d5
6.a3 Be7
7.cxd5 exd5
8.Ng3 c5
Alekhine played this as far back as his 25th match game against Euwe in 1937. By this counterattack against the white center Black removes White’s pawn from d4, and obtains the possibility of settling down at e5.
9.Bd3 Nc6
10.0-0 Re8
11.dxc5 Bxc5
12.b4 Bd6
13.Bb2 Be5
14.Na4 Bxb2
The battle is raging for d4. However, this is not an end in itself, since controlling the square in front of an isolated pawn is only important in those cases where White can establish a piece on that square and has no weaknesses himself.
Black’s further play is directed towards the enticement of White’s pieces as far as possible from d4, and the creation of weaknesses in White’s queenside pawn position. For example, this trade of darksquare bishops is favorable to White, but Black could not allow White to control the long diagonal. And besides, the white knight ends up in an out-of-the-way location, from which it would require at least four moves to reach d4.
15.Nxb2 Bg4
16.Be2 ...
White’s queen had no good retreat square, but the exchange of this pair of bishops favors Black, not White.
16...Bxe2
17.Nxe2 Qd6
18.Nd3 a6
19.Rc1 a5
Just in time. On the previous move White could have played 19.b5 to good effect; since it was important to maintain his knight at c6 then, Black played 18...a6. But now White’s a-pawn is insufficiently protected, and Black can redeploy his knight to e6, where it will hold a great deal of influence over the squares g7, f4, d4 and c5.
20.b5 Nd8
21.a4 Ne6
22.Ng3 ...
22...Qa3
Black’s queen gets behind the a-pawn. White drives it away, but it goes to c3; the rook hits it again, and it returns...
23.Ra1 Qc3
24.Rc1 Qa3
25.Ra1 Qc3
DRAW
209. Szabo—Kotov
(Nimzoindian Defense)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6
3.Nc3 Bb4
4.e3 0-0
5.Bd3 d5
6.Nf3 c5
7.0-0 Nbd7
8.Qe2 a6
9.a3 cxd4
10.exd4 dxc4
11.Bxc4 Be7
12.Ba2 ...
Black prepares to fianchetto his queen’s bishop. White’s bishop retreats a little way, so as to be able to answer ...b7-b5 with d4-d5.
12...Nb6
13.Bg5 Nfd5
White’s plan of setting up a powerful attacking position with Rfe1, Rad1, Bb1, Ne5 and f2-f4 induces Black to start this exchanging operation, resulting in a lessening of the number of pieces on the board. Thus, the threat of an immediate mating attack is gone, but White’s advantage remains, merely altering its form.
14.Bxe7 Nxc3
15.bxc3 Qxe7
16.c4 ...
16...Na4
17.Bb3 Bd7
18.Qc2 Nb6
19.c5 Rac8
20.Ne5 Rfd8
21.Qe4 ...
White’s positional advantage is indisputable. He may choose between the advance of his a-pawn to the fifth rank, permanently nailing down the pawn at b7, or an immediate attack with f2-f4-f5, or the development of his rooks to the d- and e-files. All of these are good plans, except that they are not forceful enough, and allow Black the opportunity to put together a stout defense. Szabo prefers to simplify a little, leaving himself one concrete advantage: pressure on the open file against the pawn at b7.
21...Nd5
22.Bxd5 exd5
23.Qf4 f6
24.Nxd7 Qxd7
25.Rab1 Re8
26.f3 Re7
27.Rf2 Rce8
28.Rfb2 Re1+
By the exchange of one rook, Black removes the piece that controls e1, so that later he can set up some counterplay on that file.
29.Rxe1 Rxe1+
30.Kf2 Re8
31.Rb6 ...
White’s threats are assuming concrete form: 32.Rd6. Kotov undertakes a raid with his queen, in order to distract his opponent by threatening the safety of his king.
31...Qe7
32.Qd2 Rd8
There was absolutely no reason to give up the e-file for nothing, especially when he must submit to an exchange of queens as well. The only means of resisting White’s pressure was 32...f5, for example: 33.g3 f4 34.Rd6 fxg3+ 35.hxg3 Rd8, or 33.h3 Qh4+ 34.Kf1 f4. White would still have held the advantage, but he would also have had a difficult time coordinating his attack on the b-and d-pawns with the defense of his king.
After the trade of queens that follows next move, Black winds up in a difficult rook ending.
33.Qe3 Qxe3+
34.Kxe3 Rd7
35.h4 ...
Black’s rook is tied to the defense of the b- and d-pawns. White wants to get his king to f5 or e5; Black’s next few moves prevent this, but with them he contracts a fresh weakness: the pawn at f6.
35...Kf7
36.h5 g5
37.hxg6+ Kg6
38.Kf4 h5
39.g3 Rh7
40.Ke3 Re7+
41.Kf4 Rh7
After analyzing the adjourned position, Kotov came to the conclusion that his position was hopeless, and that his only chance lay in activating his rook.
42.a4 h4
43.gxh4 Rxh4+
44.Ke3 Rh7
45.Rd6 Re7+
46.Kd3 Kg5
47.Rxd5+ Kf4
48.Rd6 f5
49.Rf6 Re1
50.Rf7 Rb1
51.a5 Rb3+
Black has done everything possible: his king has broken in, his rook is active, and the f-pawn is now twice attacked. But it’s all too late: the d-pawn will cost him the game.
52.Kc4 Rb1
53.Rf6 Rh1
54.Rb6 Rh7
55.Rb3 Rd7
56.d5 Ke5
57.d6 f4

62.Rd1
BLACK RESIGNED
210. Najdorf—Keres
(Queen’s Gambit)
1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6
3.Nc3 d5
4.Nf3 c5
5.cxd5 cxd4
6.Qxd4 exd5
7.e4 Nc6
8.Bb5 a6
Keres loves to play
va banque
, and does so with a great deal of skill, especially at the end of a tournament, when his final standing is in the balance. One can hardly help recalling the last-round wins that secured him first places in such strong tournaments as the XV, XVIII, and XIX USSR Championships, and the 1952 Budapest International.
The word “tournament” probably awakens in Keres visions of armored knights galloping towards each other with lances at the ready (and certainly not offering any draws!). Perhaps he saw himself as just such a knight when, in the final round, he elected to try for clear second place, and for the third time adopted this double-edged weapon, his new defense— or, more accurately, counterattack—to the Queen’s Gambit. The risk was very great, since his game against Geller had already looked dubious; and now Najdorf, who is known to specialize in forcing lines, would be well prepared, beyond the shadow of a doubt.
8...a6 is an improvement on the Geller - Keres game (No. 155), in which 8...Nxe4 was played.
9.Bxc6+ bxc6
10.Ne5 ...
This is better than castling here (10.0-0), when Black could reply 10...dxe4 11.Qxd8+ Kxd8 12.Ng5 Ke8. The text forces Black’s bishop to a passive position.
10...Bb7
11.exd5 Nxd5
11...Be7 has been suggested instead of the text. White might have replied 12.d6 Qxd6 13.Qxd6 Bxd6 14.Nc4, with the better game, due to the weakness of the black a- and c-pawns. Still, this was better than 11...Nxd5, since Black could thereby have avoided subjecting himself to the perils of the direct attack that now encircles his king.
12.0-0 Be7
13.Nxc6 ...
A pretty piece sacrifice, with the idea of keeping Black’s king in the center and attacking it there with White’s rooks, queen and minor pieces. Keres has caught a Tartar, indeed!
13...Bxc6
14.Qxg7 Rf8
15.Re1 Qd6
16.Nxe4
DRAW
Najdorf did not play 16.Nxd5, in view of 16...Qxd5; on almost any White reply, Black castles queenside, and then plays ...Rg8, with very dangerous threats, for example: 17.Bh6 0-0-0 18.Qg4+ f5, or 18.Rxe7 Rg8, and White cannot defend g2.
The next day, after the tournament had already ended, Najdorf, with his usual Argentine fervor, showed all the participants that 17.Bf4 would have won anyway: 17...0-0-0 would be met by 18.Rxe7 Rg8 19.Rc7+. And if 16...Bxd5 instead, then 17.Bg5 Be6 18.Rad1 Qb4 19.Bh6, with a powerful attack. In reply, Keres just smiled...
