Understanding Chess Middlegames
John Nunn
The middlegame is the phase of the chess battle where most games are decided, yet is the one that has received the least systematic treatment from chess writers. With the outstanding clarity for which he is famous, Nunn breaks down complex problems into bite-sized pieces. Each of the 100 lessons features two inspiring examples from modern chess, with a clear focus on the key instructive points.

How to Calculate Chess Tactics
Valeri Beim
Thinking methods are at the heart of the chess struggle, yet most players devote little conscious effort to improving their calculating ability. Much of the previous literature on the subject has presented idealized models that have limited relevance to the hurly-burly of practical chess, or else provide little more than
ad hoc
suggestions. Here, experienced trainer Valeri Beim strikes a balance by explaining how to use intuition and logic together to solve tactical problems in a methodical way. He also offers advice on when it is best to calculate ‘l

Two moves is more than most players can see.

Three moves is about the maximum for serious tournament players.

But masters must calculate much further?

Yes, when they believe they need to calculate.

But they make most of their moves without that much look-ahead.

Even elite players are not calculating machines.

Viacheslav Eingorn and Valentin Bogdanov
The French appeals to a wide range of chess temperaments: it is solid yet uncompromising, and with a variety of chaotic variations to appeal to the most bloodthirsty of players, but also offering more tranquil lines to those seeking a quieter existence. Chess Explained books provide an understanding of an opening and the middlegames to which it leads, enabling you to find the right moves and plans in your own games.

I can’t attack without my queen and other pieces.

Why should I want to trade them?

Attacking is one of the three basic ways of winning a chess game.

The other two are amassing a material edge and accumulating positional assets.

A good trade can improve your chances of success in all three ways.

But trades are just trades.

How do they help me win?

There is often a subtle difference between the traded pieces.

The castled position is weakened when any of the pawns that form the protective barrier in front of the king – namely the f-, g- and h-pawns – have advanced.

It is more weakening to advance a pawn two squares than one, and even more weakening when more than one pawn has been advanced.

Other types of structural weakness occur when one of the pawns is either lost or doubled.

Some authors claim you must master 100 or more “book” positions to play endgames well.

This is not true.

All you really need to know are some of the positions with relatively little material, such as with fewer than six pieces and pawns.

Don’t worry about the more complex endgames.

Until you are a better than average player, most of your endgames will be pretty one-sided.

Either you or your opponent will probably be a minor piece or several pawns ahead.

Secrets of Positional Chess
Dražen Marović
How can one determine if a piece is weak or strong? Or if a square is weak or strong? These are the principal questions that grandmaster and trainer Dražen Marović addresses in this important book. By discussing carefully-chosen games and positions, Marović explains how to recognize good and bad features of positions, and how to make use of one’s advantages and exploit the opponent’s weaknesses.

Improve Your Positional Chess
Carsten Hansen
Throughout a game of chess, we must constantly make judgements and decisions that cannot be determined simply by calculation. We must then rely on our positional judgement. Good positional skills are primarily developed by experience, but they can also be learnt. In this book, Carsten Hansen provides a wealth of advice and ideas that will help give readers a helping-hand up to new levels of positional understanding. Paramount in this discussion is the player’s need to weigh up positional elements at the board, and decide which are most important for

I will now tell you why: first, the effort required to solve these positions will be useful training for practical play, since knowing the theory is not enough, you have to be able to apply that theory to an actual game.

Moreover, each reader will find some of these positions more difficult than others.

Thus he will get an idea of his weak points and can pay more attention to those positions when he reaches them in his study.

Evaluating

Why is it important to evaluate a position?

When you choose a move to play, you want to know whether it improves your winning chances.

But you can’t know this unless you compare the consequences of that move with the consequences of other moves.

Opponents constantly evaluate moves in a game.

They often come to the same conclusion – up to a point.

What is chess training?

Training includes everything that can prepare you to play at your best.

It means studying but also physical exercise, playing practice games, being well rested and so on.

Mikhail Botvinnik devised a personal training method that helped make him the world’s best player.

His regimen included taking a nap before a round and how he walked to the tournament site.

(Take the same route at the same time every round, he said.)

Sacrificing
253.

Why does a sacrifice make sense?

It means you have less material to attack with.

But not at the area of the board you are attacking.

Compare it with war: A more skillful army may win when it concentrates its forces at an area where a larger army is spread thin.

By giving up some of his material, the sacrificer hopes to generate greater force at that point of attack.

A sacrifice turns “matter into energy,” as a great attacking player of the past, Rudolf Spielmann, put it.

The sacrifice of a pawn, sometimes even an important one, can be the very key needed to unlock the enemy position. Many masters have appreciated the effectiveness of this method, even some who are particularly anxious to preserve their material and customarily prefer to win by technical means.
By the term

4.7: The Exchange Sacrifice
The ‘exchange’ is the name we give to the difference in value between a rook and a minor piece.

Hence we frequently find in chess books and magazines the expressions “win the exchange”, “sacrificing the exchange”, “the exchange up”, etc.

An exchange sacrifice – giving up a rook for a bishop or a knight – can be an extraordinarily effective way to change the course of a game.

This is partly because players subconsciously regard a well-protected minor piece as immune to the threat of capture by a rook.

This is a vast subject, especially when long-term positional e

4.4: Other Bishop Sacrifices
The particular weaknesses in the castled position and the precise deployment of the pieces will, in every case, dictate the most effective course of attack.

The sacrifice of a minor piece for one or two pawns, with the added value of the structural damage to the defender’s castled position, is a procedure which is usually effective when the attacker’s remaining pieces are in a position to launch a rapid offensive.

Winning a Won Game

Why do masters say, “Nothing is harder than winning a won game”?

Winning “technique,” as it is called, is difficult to master because it requires skills very different from those used in the other phases of a game.

Instead of accumulating advantages, you need to exploit them.

First, White must transfer the move to his opponent, as the black pieces occupy their ideal positions (apart from the loss of distant effectiveness).

Moreover, that third square has become a third critical defensive position.

We just have to look for squares where the white king can threaten two (or 3, if possible) key squares, and then check whether Black has an appropriate answer in each case.

There is no need to go deeply into theory to find a triangulation through d4 and c4.

The king attacks c5 and d5 from those squares.

Black lacks a manoeuvre to answer this, so he loses the correspondence and thus the game.
