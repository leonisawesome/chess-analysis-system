## REMAINING WORK

### One Moskalenko Duplicate Still Present
The duplicate detection found 32 books, but 31 were already deleted.
Only ONE remains:
- moskalenko_2019_an_attacking_repertoire_for_white_with_1d4_nic_no_dg.epub (859 diagrams)
- KEEP: moskalenko_2019_an_attacking_repertoire_for_white_with_1d4_nic.epub (2,316 diagrams)
- DELETE: moskalenko_2019_an_attacking_repertoire_for_white_with_1d4_nic_no_dg.epub

## CONFUSION EXPLAINED
The extraction_full.log was created BEFORE the first duplicate cleanup, so when we
re-analyzed it, it still contained references to the 36 already-deleted books. This
made it appear we had 32 new duplicates, when in reality we only have 1 remaining.

## NEXT STEP
Delete the one remaining Moskalenko duplicate from:
1. EPUB directory
2. Image directory  
3. Qdrant database
