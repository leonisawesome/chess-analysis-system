How to Calculate Chess Tactics
Valeri Beim
Thinking methods are at the heart of the chess struggle, yet most players devote little conscious effort to improving their calculating ability. Much of the previous literature on the subject has presented idealized models that have limited relevance to the hurly-burly of practical chess, or else provide little more than
ad hoc
suggestions. Here, experienced trainer Valeri Beim strikes a balance by explaining how to use intuition and logic together to solve tactical problems in a methodical way. He also offers advice on when it is best to calculate ‘l

Two moves is more than most players can see.

Three moves is about the maximum for serious tournament players.

But masters must calculate much further?

Yes, when they believe they need to calculate.

But they make most of their moves without that much look-ahead.

Even elite players are not calculating machines.

Understanding Chess Middlegames
John Nunn
The middlegame is the phase of the chess battle where most games are decided, yet is the one that has received the least systematic treatment from chess writers. With the outstanding clarity for which he is famous, Nunn breaks down complex problems into bite-sized pieces. Each of the 100 lessons features two inspiring examples from modern chess, with a clear focus on the key instructive points.

A good trade can improve your chances of success in all three ways.

The castled position is weakened when any of the pawns that form the protective barrier in front of the king – namely the f-, g- and h-pawns – have advanced.

It is more weakening to advance a pawn two squares than one, and even more weakening when more than one pawn has been advanced.

Other types of structural weakness occur when one of the pawns is either lost or doubled.

Tactics

What exactly are tactics?

Tactics are the short-term exploitation of your opponent’s pieces.

The typical goal is to win material, anything from a pawn to a queen.

Most tactics are based on attacking two things at once.

In essence, a tactic wins because your opponent cannot make two moves in a row to meet both of your threats.

59.

Can you win a game without tactics?

Yes, but victory usually occurs because someone resigns before a decisive tactic.

A player can justifiably give up before a single capture is made.

Beyond that point, greater endgame skill is a must.

Improve Your Positional Chess
Carsten Hansen
Throughout a game of chess, we must constantly make judgements and decisions that cannot be determined simply by calculation. We must then rely on our positional judgement. Good positional skills are primarily developed by experience, but they can also be learnt. In this book, Carsten Hansen provides a wealth of advice and ideas that will help give readers a helping-hand up to new levels of positional understanding. Paramount in this discussion is the player’s need to weigh up positional elements at the board, and decide which are most important for

Secrets of Positional Chess
Dražen Marović
How can one determine if a piece is weak or strong? Or if a square is weak or strong? These are the principal questions that grandmaster and trainer Dražen Marović addresses in this important book. By discussing carefully-chosen games and positions, Marović explains how to recognize good and bad features of positions, and how to make use of one’s advantages and exploit the opponent’s weaknesses.

What is an outpost?

One player’s pawn hole is his opponent’s potential outpost.

Black’s move in the next diagram is a positional blunder because it hands White an outpost square.

Evaluating

Why is it important to evaluate a position?

When you choose a move to play, you want to know whether it improves your winning chances.

But you can’t know this unless you compare the consequences of that move with the consequences of other moves.

Opponents constantly evaluate moves in a game.

They often come to the same conclusion – up to a point.

Chapter Twelve:
Sacrificing
253.

Why does a sacrifice make sense?

It means you have less material to attack with.

But not at the area of the board you are attacking.

Compare it with war: A more skillful army may win when it concentrates its forces at an area where a larger army is spread thin.

By giving up some of his material, the sacrificer hopes to generate greater force at that point of attack.

A sacrifice turns “matter into energy,” as a great attacking player of the past, Rudolf Spielmann, put it.

Are there different ways of doing that?

Note:
Exchange sacrifices on f3 are thematic in this line, but Black also needs
something else for it, like White’s d4-pawn – which Tal didn’t get in this instance.

Some philosophers claim that virtue can only be nurtured when it is isolated from contaminating temptations.

Technically this move is unsound.

Feeling squeezed, Tal husbands his forces into a desperate lunge at White’s semi-exposed king.

I suppose our vows of temperance and moderation turn into dim memories when we feel temptation’s caress.

The sacrifice of a pawn, sometimes even an important one, can be the very key needed to unlock the enemy position. Many masters have appreciated the effectiveness of this method, even some who are particularly anxious to preserve their material and customarily prefer to win by technical means.
By the term

The particular weaknesses in the castled position and the precise deployment of the pieces will, in every case, dictate the most effective course of attack.

The sacrifice of a minor piece for one or two pawns, with the added value of the structural damage to the defender’s castled position, is a procedure which is usually effective when the attacker’s remaining pieces are in a position to launch a rapid offensive.

Why do masters say, “Nothing is harder than winning a won game”?

Winning “technique,” as it is called, is difficult to master because it requires skills very different from those used in the other phases of a game.

Instead of accumulating advantages, you need to exploit them.

Moreover, that third square has become a third critical defensive position.

We just have to look for squares where the white king can threaten two (or 3, if possible) key squares, and then check whether Black has an appropriate answer in each case.

There is no need to go deeply into theory to find a triangulation through d4 and c4.

The king attacks c5 and d5 from those squares.

Black lacks a manoeuvre to answer this, so he loses the correspondence and thus the game.
