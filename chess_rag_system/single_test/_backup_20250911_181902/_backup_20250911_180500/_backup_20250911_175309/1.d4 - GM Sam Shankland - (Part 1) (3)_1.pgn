1. d4
{ Welcome to my Lifetime Repertoires series on playing 1.d4 from the white side! My goal with this series of 3 courses is within the title itself - I hope to present an opening repertoire that can last a lifetime.   I have favored 1.d4 for most of my career, and I will be presenting a repertoire based on the attitude I take to my own games whenever I open with the queen's pawn. I would consider this repertoire to be very strategically aggressive. It definitely has its dynamic moments and plenty of key lines to memorize, but for the most part, the goal is not to tear Black's head off in the first 20 moves of the game, as one might see in some attacking repertoires. Rather, its goal is to fight for long term advantages right from the first move of the game, including but not limited to extra space, a better structure, the bishop pair, etc.   This is not to say that I will not advocate launching an attack when I believe it is the best way- I certainly will. But all things being equal, the goal is to play strong, ambitious, strategic chess. A good way of thinking about it is to rate a repertoire based on its sharpness from 1 to 10. Super quiet lines like the Torre Attack would be a 1, and these are not particularly challenging. Black can play more or less any move and count on a fine position. But the other end of the spectrum is not that much better. The sharpest lines, such as the Bg5 Najdorf, often have a long string of forced moves for both sides with no room for innovation along the way without getting a disastrous position, and they often end in direct perpetual check or draws of some kind. Lines like these tend not to be too problematic for Black either. Memorize a few long lines, and you're good to go.   I think the most challenging ways White can handle the opening tend to be in the 6-8 range on the 1 to 10 sharpness scale, and I think this repertoire fits nicely into said range. I am playing very strategically ambitious lines, often forcing Black into dynamic positions and making difficult decisions because simple moves will end up being worse for him. If Black does something noncritical against lines like these, he seldom dies on the spot, but often ends up in a seriously unpleasant position.   Creating an entire opening repertoire within 1.d4 would produce an absolutely massive course, so I decided to break it into 3 parts. Part 1 is on all sidelines, which I define as anything other then 1.d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 or g6, and 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6, c6, and dxc4. Of course, some sidelines are more serious than others. The Dutch, Benko, and Benoni are surely more challenging than the Albin, Chigorin, and Budapest, but I had to draw the line somewhere.   Part 2 will be on 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 and then covering Black's 2 main moves in 2...e6 and 2...g6, while part 3 will be on 1.d4 d5 2.c4 and now the 3 main moves in c6, e6, and dxc4.   I chose to do the sidelines part first for two main reasons. First off, I think it is the best way to learn any opening- one should always get the easy stuff out of the way first and have a clear plate ready for when the more challenging lines show up. It's always a shame to spend hours studying and learning all the mainlines, only to lose to some lazy loser who plays some nonsense that you weren't ready for since you had only addressed the theoretically approved tries. The giddy happiness of such clowns @@StartBracket@@who profess the merits of playing stupid openings to try to catch someone off guard@@EndBracket@@ when they succeed at their goal is like nails on a chalkboard to a serious chess player!   The second reason is rather selfish. I'm at the point where I am strong enough that I don't see sidelines too often in my own practice. As of the time of this writing, mid-July 2020, the world is still shut down from COVID. My hope is that as the world opens back up and tournaments come back, I will be able to use the analysis I do when covering the mainlines in my own games before it is published on Chessable! If it's good enough for me, hopefully, it is good enough for you as well. A big part of making a repertoire is choosing your battles. The human brain can only retain so many lines and so much information, and wanting to know absolutely every best move at every juncture is clearly impossible. Those who studied my Semi-Slav course will remember that against non-critical lines, I often chose the easiest possible solution, contenting myself with comfortable equality with a few simple moves rather than fighting tooth and nail to be better with Black right away. I took the same attitude towards the sidelines in this course as well.   If I believed there was an easy solution that gives a simple, pleasant advantage, I chose that line, no questions asked. But, for tougher sidelines, such as the aforementioned Dutch, Benoni, and Benko, I did not shy away from more theoretically demanding options, as I believe they are necessary to prove an advantage. I expect part 2 and part 3 to both be released before the end of 2020. This course is not a prerequisite per se, but I do think it will be a great place to get started, making sure that you have all of the minor lines covered before we hit the ground running. As usual, I have done my best to gather all of the relevant chess literature I could find recommending any of these lines from Black's point of view, and cite exactly where I left their analysis or disagree with their conclusions. The following lines are all covered in the course. Happy studying! }

1. d4 b6
{ The Owen's Defense is almost completely unseen in the modern era, and to me, it feels like the poor cousin of the English Defense, when Black at least prevents White from playing e2-e4 so comfortably. White certainly could try to transpose to the section on the  Wade Defense , but I think here he can take the entire center. }
2. e4
{ 2.c4  This is fine as well. After  Bb7  3.Nc3  e6  4.a3  White will transpose to the English Defense chapter. As far as I can see, he is a bit better here. But I think he can be more ambitious if he is allowed to take the whole center on move  2. }
2... Bb7 3. Bd3
{ This is the main starting position of the Owen's Defense. Black obviously looks a bit worse with less space in the center, and he needs to find a way to put pressure on White's position. The outlandish f7-f5 basically loses, and against everything else, I think White has an easy plan. }

1. d4 d6
{ With this move, Black is aiming to play into the Pirc Defense. White certainly could advance e2-e4 here, and I think he has every chance to fight for an advantage, but after Ng8-f6, White is forced to play Nb1-c3, blocking the c-pawn and making it hard to play a positionally challenging line, instead of having to look for more of an attacking position that we would associate more with e4 on the first move. I like remaining consistent with the repertoire and not giving up on c4 just yet, hoping to get a big pawn center with c4, d4, and e4. }
2. Nf3
{ This prevents Black from playing e7-e5. Now, he has many transpositions available- f5 would promptly take us to a Leningrad or Classical Dutch, and both 2...Nf6 and 2...g6 are likely to end up in a King's Indian. }
2... Bg4 { This is Black only extraneous try. } 3. e3
{ White has a lot of other options, but I like this simple one the best. He nips any hopes of Bxf3, disturbing his structure, in the bud, and has a very straightforward plan involving c2-c4, Nb1-c3, Bf1-e2, and 0-0. Then, once he has completed development and kept everything nice and solid, he can eventually look to expand further in the center with e3-e4. I can't find a great way for Black to make any trouble for this plan. }
3... g6
{ This move feels like Black's best option to me. He will play some kind of King's Indian setup and hope to put pressure on the d4 pawn by means of e7-e5 at the right moment, aiming to prevent White from advancing e3-e4. But still, I think White retains a nice edge. }

If you wish to play this way, by all means, go for it! I would recommend GM Harikrishna's repertoire as a good way to play. But, for our purposes, I will keep the game in d4 territory. }

5. d5
{ Again, White takes the space in the center. But since Black has played f7-f5, the same development scheme of g3, Bg2, Nf3, and O-O is not as convincing- Black will play Na6-c5-e4 and then be able to take back with the pawn when the d5 pawn will come under fire. But White is better if he knows what to do. The key is to remember that if Black has played f7-f5, it is necessary to always meet Na6 with b4, stopping Nc5. This is because the plan of Na6-c5-e4 is much more annoying when fxe4 is available to Black after the inevitable knight exchange, and because f7-f5 is a slower move than Nf6, meaning White will have enough time to play b4 without anything horrible happening to him. }

The knight on h6 cannot move due to the f7 pawn hanging. The f7 pawn cannot move due to the weakness of the e6 square. And the h8 rook cannot move without hanging h7. So...

4... Be7 5. Nf3
{ this move looks a little paradoxical, as White should generally be trying to avoid a piece exchange. But it is justified because Black really wants to exchange off the dark-squared bishop, not the light-squared bishop.

1. d4 f5 2. c4 Nf6 3. g3 e6 4. Bg2
{ Now Black has a choice to make- he can either go for the Classical Dutch with Be7 or into a stonewall with c6 followed by d5. }
4... c6 5. Nf3 d5 6. O-O Bd6
{ This is the typical starting position of the Stonewall Dutch. It does not have the best reputation, for a few reasons. As I wrote about in my Semi-Slav course where I recommended a Stonewall setup against 4.e3, my contention was that if White can ever neutralize the d6 bishop with either Nf3-e5 or exchange it off with Bc1-a3, he will be clearly better as Black will be a bit worse on the queenside thanks to his lack of space and the passive bishop on b7. He really needs the d6 bishop to stay alive so that it can help launch a kingside attack. This position is a little different for a couple of reasons. First off, White's king is much safer thanks to the fianchetto shutting down the d6 bishop, but also the bishop on g2 is quite passive, which gives Black an extra option of developing his queen's bishop to b7 or a6 in a way that would be much harder to pull off if White's bishop were on a square like d3. White has multiple routes to a nice edge, but I found one that I really like for its simplicity and clarity. }
7. b3
{ This is the main move by far. White makes the strategic threat of Bc1-a3. }
7... Qe7
{ It's hard for me to imagine any other move being played. Black stops Ba3 while developing a new piece. Historically, White has usually tried to get Bc1-a3 in at all costs, either with Bb2, Qc1, and Ba3 or with a4 and then Ba3. These are not such stupid plans, but I think they have some drawbacks and would prefer to play in another way that will attempt to prevent Black from completing his development. }
8. Ne5
{ White immediately pounces on the weakened e5-square, another prescribed way of shutting down the bishop on d6. But the move has another purpose as well- White is trying to restrict the development of the c8-bishop. If Black ever plays Nbd7, the weakness of the c6 pawn means that b7-b6 will not be possible. So, his best plan is to play b6, Bb7, and then Nbd7. But I have a plan for that as well. }
8... O-O { Now White has a very clever idea. } 9. Qc2
{ This is a very rare, but very clever move. I think White's best plan with his minor pieces is to play Nd3 and Bf4, but it is important to wait for a move. Black now has to figure out what to do about the light-squared bishop. He can try either b6 or Bd7-e8.   9.Bb2  This is less effective after  9...Bd7  When Black is ready for  Be8  and  Nbd7.  The machine gives White some edge but I am not particularly convinced.   9.Nd3  Trying the right plan at the wrong moment fails to impress. After  9...Nbd7  10.Bf4  Bxf4  11.Nxf4  Black has some counterplay with  11...dxc4  Pointing out that since White has not yet placed his queen on c2, he must take back with the pawn. But after  12.bxc4  e5  White will be left with an isolani on  c4 , and Black looks okay to me.   9.Bf4  Nh5  This is a bit annoying. }

{ The Classical Dutch is almost completely unseen at top level, but it has some proponents. Simon Williams has done a course on it right here on Chessable, and he put his money where his mouth is when he beat Boris Gelfand. A single good game is not enough to change my mind about the opening being bad, but it definitely means that White should take it seriously and know what to do. }
5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O d6 7. Nc3
{ White has a very simple and very direct plan- he wants to fight for the e2-e4 advance. If he gets it in, Black will be left with long term problems with his king as well as a terrible backward pawn on e6, blunting his bishop. In general, I think if Black makes any move other than Ne4, Qc2 is really going to hurt. }
7... Ne4
{ This has to be the most critical move. Black occupies the e4 square before White can control it and push e4 through, and at a moment with his queen back on d8 so that Nxe4 followed by Ng5 is not possible. It is also Williams' recommendation in his course here on Chessable. }
8. Nxe4
{ White can and should accept the challenge. Black will struggle to hold the center together. }
8... fxe4 9. Ne1
{ This somewhat surprising move promises White a big advantage. It looks a little weird as the knight is a bit passive, but the main point is that it is out of the way of the bishop on c1. White's main plan involves playing f2-f3, and the knight will recapture.   9.Nd2  Williams gives a lot of long lines after this move, ultimately claiming that Black is okay. I am very skeptical of this conclusion, but I also find it irrelevant as White has a better idea. }
9... d5 { And now Williams does not consider White's best move. } 10. Be3
{ White simply bolsters his center. His plan is to play Rc1 next, keeping c4 protected, and once everything is safe and secure, then and only then he will play f3.   10.f3  Williams only considers this move, which is a bit cooperative. I am not at all convinced that Black is equalizing after his intended  ...Nc6  11.fxe4  Rxf1+  12.Kxf1  dxc4  but once again, White has a better option. }

Unsurprisingly, no serious chess player has played it in a very long time, but White should still be ready. There are plenty of decent options, but my favorite is the rather simple }
4. Nd2

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 d6 4. Nc3 g6
{ Black is trying to play a Benoni with delaying e6 and exd5. This is not such a stupid idea, because as soon as the moves exd5 and cxd5 are played, the c4 square becomes available for White's knight. Black can delay this capture for a while, hoping that White's inability to play Nc4 will run him out of useful moves, but it does contain one drawback that I am hoping to exploit. }
5. e4 Bg7 6. Nf3
{ This is very simple and straightforward. White will develop with Be2 and O-O, and he will take back with the e-pawn on d5 to maintain a symmetrical structure with a pleasant space advantage. }
6... O-O 7. Be2 e6 8. O-O
{ 8.Nd2  This would be the consistent move with the  Nd2  line of the Benoni, but it's not as effective now since White cannot force Black to take on  d5 and allow Nc4  . After  8...Na6  9.O-O  Nc7  We see that the generally desirable  Nc4 is impossible and it feels like Black has more useful waiting moves than White Re8, Rb8, b6, a6, Bd7, etc and eventually, he will play exd5 when the time is right. Since White cannot play Nc4 at any moment, I do not trust this position for him. }
8... exd5
{ Black didn't have much of a choice as White was threatening to take on e6 and play Bf4 next. }
9. exd5
{ Easy does it. White accepts a simple position with some extra space. In general, I think Black would be more or less lost if he cannot exchange any minor pieces, and absolutely fine if he could exchange off two sets. As far as I can tell, he can only get one pair off the board. So he is not crushed, but white is definitely better. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 b5
{ In my opinion, the Benko Gambit is a somewhat underrated opening. I think anyone with half a brain knows that White is objectively better, but of all the lines that Black can choose where he accepts a worse position for practical chances in an unbalanced game, I think the Benko is one of his best options. I've certainly managed to mess it up from the White side time and again, and I have never lost playing it with Black. I think the most important thing for White to do is to find a setup that promises him a safe position where he won't have to make a ton of difficult decisions or contain a lot of counterplay, and I am willing to accept a smaller objective advantage to reach this goal. }
4. cxb5 a6 5. bxa6 g6 6. Nc3 Bxa6
{ For a long time, nearly every game in the Benko featured this move. But I think it is actually quite a bit worse than the Modern Mainline with Bg7. The reason is that it all comes down to the same key f1-a6 diagonal. White can play e4 to contest it, castle by hand, and then Black will not get his queen to a6 in time to make any trouble. }
7. e4 Bxf1 8. Kxf1 d6 { Otherwise, e5 was coming. } 9. Nf3 Bg7 10. g3 O-O 11.
Kg2
{ Now all White has to do to reach a more or less winning position is play a4, Ra3, and Nb5. This will block the b-file where Black is looking for counterplay, and then White can complete his development with b3 and Bb2, leaving Black with no compensation. Some care must be taken not to hang e4, but if White is precise, he should secure a big advantage. }
11... Nbd7
{ This is the most common move by far, though it certainly does not equalize. }
12. a4
{ This move was found as far back as 2012 when Larry Kaufman recommended it for White in his repertoire book for White and Black. Any book written that long ago will be mostly outdated, which it largely is, but it says a lot about the quality of Kaufman's work that even a single line has stood the test of time for 8 whole years. White is ready with the standard plan of preparing Nb5 to shut down the b-file and then gradually maneuver the b1-bishop to the long diagonal, leaving Black with no compensation. }
12... Ra6
{ This is another coordination Black can consider, where he brings the queen to a8 to pressure the e4/d5 pawn chain with e6 and he clears the 8th rank to get the rook to b8. It makes quite a bit of sense, but White should be better if he knows what to do. }
13. Qe2 Qa8 14. Ra3
{ b3 is coming next and White is good to go. A good rule of thumb for the Benko Gambit is that if Black ever plays e6 after already playing d6, White should take it and force Black to take with the f-pawn to mess up his structure. This position is no exception. }

Since then, however, nobody has really managed to revive it, and not without reason. It's hard to believe that Black can give up a central pawn so early in the game without getting that much of a lead in development. }
3. dxe5 { The best way to refute any gambit is to accept it. } 3... d4 4. Nf3
Nc6
{ Now, White has several development schemes available to him, almost all of which show a clear advantage. I like one of the main ones, but with one of my own twists. }
5. Nbd2
{ White's play is very direct. He wants Nb3 and Nbxd4. If he can take the d4 pawn in exchange for either the e5 pawn or the c4 pawn, he will be able to easily complete development with e3 and Be2. And as far as I can tell, Black can't really stop him. }
5... Nge7
{ In recent years, this has been Black's most common move, trying to save the d4 pawn. }
6. Nb3 Nf5
{ Playing like this, Black is able to save the d4-pawn, but it comes at a heavy price. The knight on f5 is quite clumsy. Now, the main move is e4, which is certainly not bad, but I am loathe to give myself doubled isolated pawns when it is not necessary. I think the easiest solution is }
7. g3
{ White wants Bg2 and O-O, and is happy to sacrifice the c4 pawn for the sake of rapid development. The plan will eventually be O-O, Qc2, and Rd1. }
7... a5 8. Bd2
{ Before Bg2, White make sure to clear the c1 square for the knight, which is clearly about to get kicked. }
8... Qe7 { This way Black at least gets his pawn back, but after } 9. Bg2 a4
10. Nc1 Nxe5 11. Nxe5 Qxe5 12. Nd3
{ White is obviously better due to his lead in development and the fantastic bishop on g2. If Black ever plays c6, White should always look out for the plan of b2-b4-b5. }

1. d4 d5 2. c4 Nc6
{ The Chigorin, much like the Albin, had its day in the early 2000s. In more recent years, Richard Rapport has played it now and then, though even he has gravitated more towards mainlines as he has stabilized in the mid-2700s. White has several decent plans, and as usual for these sidelines, I prefer one that leads to a nice edge without a ton of effort as opposed to remembering a lot of concrete lines to win right out of the opening. }
3. Nf3
{ First and foremost - White prevents  e5  @@StartBracket@@. As usual, if this move can be prevented, the knight on c6 will look ridiculous. Now, White is ready to take on@@EndBracket@@  c5  next unless Black does something to dissuade him.   3.cxd5  This is the main move but after  ...Qxd5  4.e3  e5  Black managed to get  e5  in. White is surely still better after  5.Nc3  Bb4  but the position offers Black more dynamic practical chances than I would like. }
3... Bg4
{ Otherwise Black's position would make no sense at all. At least here White cannot take on d5 while simultaneously preventing e5. }
4. Nc3
{ Now that White has gotten  Nf3  in, This move is much easier to justify as Black cannot take on  c4.   4.cxd5  Bxf3  Again, Black is able to get  e5  through.  5.gxf3  Qxd5  6.e3  e5  7.Nc3  Bb4  White must be better here but Black has some dynamic potential. Practically speaking, I really dislike allowing  e5. }
4... e6
{ Now that Black has secured the d5 square reasonably well, here he could think about taking on f3 for real next. I don't think this will promise him equality, but I still wish to deny him the option of doing so before white gets e3 in. }
5. cxd5 exd5 6. Bg5
{ 6. Bf4 Bxf3 I find this to be much less convincing. There is no need to let the pawns be doubled. }
6... Be7 7. Bxe7 Ngxe7 8. e3 O-O 9. Bd3
{ Black is a bit worse here. The knight on c6 is thoroughly dominated by White's pawns, and it means that moves like Rc1 and Qb3 are quite hard to meet, while if the knight were on d7 and the c-pawn could advance to c6, this would clearly not be the case. Black should watch out for Bxh7+ here as well, though even if he misses the threat, it's hard to see a move that blunders it. }

{ With this move, Black is aiming to play into the Pirc Defense. White certainly could advance e2-e4 here, and I think he has every chance to fight for an advantage, but after Ng8-f6, White is forced to play Nb1-c3, blocking the c-pawn and making it hard to play a positionally challenging line, instead of having to look for more of an attacking position that we would associate more with e4 on the first move. I like remaining consistent with the repertoire and not giving up on c4 just yet, hoping to get a big pawn center with c4, d4, and e4. }
2. Nf3
{ This prevents Black from playing e7-e5. Now, he has many transpositions available- f5 would promptly take us to a Leningrad or Classical Dutch, and both 2...Nf6 and 2...g6 are likely to end up in a King's Indian. }
2... Bg4 { This is Black only extraneous try. } 3. e3
{ White has a lot of other options, but I like this simple one the best. He nips any hopes of Bxf3, disturbing his structure, in the bud, and has a very straightforward plan involving c2-c4, Nb1-c3, Bf1-e2, and 0-0. Then, once he has completed development and kept everything nice and solid, he can eventually look to expand further in the center with e3-e4. I can't find a great way for Black to make any trouble for this plan. }

First off, White's king is much safer thanks to the fianchetto shutting down the d6 bishop, but also the bishop on g2 is quite passive, which gives Black an extra option of developing his queen's bishop to b7 or a6 in a way that would be much harder to pull off if White's bishop were on a square like d3. White has multiple routes to a nice edge, but I found one that I really like for its simplicity and clarity. }

Historically, White has usually tried to get Bc1-a3 in at all costs, either with Bb2, Qc1, and Ba3 or with a4 and then Ba3. These are not such stupid plans, but I think they have some drawbacks and would prefer to play in another way that will attempt to prevent Black from completing his development. }
8. Ne5
{ White immediately pounces on the weakened e5-square, another prescribed way of shutting down the bishop on d6. But the move has another purpose as well- White is trying to restrict the development of the c8-bishop. If Black ever plays Nbd7, the weakness of the c6 pawn means that b7-b6 will not be possible. So, his best plan is to play b6, Bb7, and then Nbd7. But I have a plan for that as well. }

{ This is a very rare, but very clever move. I think White's best plan with his minor pieces is to play Nd3 and Bf4, but it is important to wait for a move.

{ The Classical Dutch is almost completely unseen at top level, but it has some proponents. Simon Williams has done a course on it right here on Chessable, and he put his money where his mouth is when he beat Boris Gelfand. A single good game is not enough to change my mind about the opening being bad, but it definitely means that White should take it seriously and know what to do. }
5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O d6 7. Nc3
{ White has a very simple and very direct plan- he wants to fight for the e2-e4 advance. If he gets it in, Black will be left with long term problems with his king as well as a terrible backward pawn on e6, blunting his bishop. In general, I think if Black makes any move other than Ne4, Qc2 is really going to hurt. }
7... Ne4
{ This has to be the most critical move. Black occupies the e4 square before White can control it and push e4 through, and at a moment with his queen back on d8 so that Nxe4 followed by Ng5 is not possible. It is also Williams' recommendation in his course here on Chessable. }
8. Nxe4
{ White can and should accept the challenge. Black will struggle to hold the center together. }
8... fxe4 9. Ne1
{ This somewhat surprising move promises White a big advantage. It looks a little weird as the knight is a bit passive, but the main point is that it is out of the way of the bishop on c1. White's main plan involves playing f2-f3, and the knight will recapture.   9.Nd2  Williams gives a lot of long lines after this move, ultimately claiming that Black is okay. I am very skeptical of this conclusion, but I also find it irrelevant as White has a better idea. }
9... d5 { And now Williams does not consider White's best move. } 10. Be3
{ White simply bolsters his center. His plan is to play Rc1 next, keeping c4 protected, and once everything is safe and secure, then and only then he will play f3.   10.f3  Williams only considers this move, which is a bit cooperative. I am not at all convinced that Black is equalizing after his intended  Nc6  11.fxe4  Rxf1  12.Kxf1  dxc4  but once again, White has a better option. }
10... Nc6 11. Rc1
{ White is now ready for f2-f3 next, and there is absolutely nothing Black can do about it. There is no counterplay or messy positions that one might see if Black were able to take c4 and hang onto it, and Black is in big trouble. }

{ I originally recommended the direct f2-f4 here, but deep computer analysis shows that Black can get reasonable counterplay with some very imaginative play. Upon a closer examination, I prefer regrouping the knight and taking advantage of the knight on e5 blocking the e-file, making the loose pawn on e4 a non-issue. By getting off of d2, White also has opened up the c1-bishop, which prevents Black from achieving the strategically desirable g6-g5 advance to secure the knight. }

14. f4 Neg4

White has wasted two moves on Nd2-f1-d2, and he played f2-f4. Black has wasted two moves on Nd7-e5-d7, and he played h7-h6. It should be pretty clear which side this favors. }
15. Bf3 h5
{ With the knight back on d2, White would be facing some tough threats here connected with a sacrifice on d5 to bring the bishop to d4. Since the e3-square is under control, he can safely play the text move. }
16. h3

White can look to slowly but surely prepare for f2-f4 and Ne3-c4, and he should be a bit better. }

{ I always liked this way of handling the White side of the Benoni. White does not want to allow the light-squared bishop to be exchanged by means of Bc8-g4, and rather than burning a tempo on h3, he instead brings his knight back to d2 pre-emptively. The knight obviously is not glorious on d2, but it is on the way to eventually c4. It should be noted that this move is also the recommendation of Daniel Barrish in his Queen's Gambit course, and while my repertoire looks very different from his overall, this chapter has some similarities. Still, I have a somewhat different way of handling the resulting positions. }
7... Bg7 8. e4 O-O 9. Be2
{ This is the main starting position of the Nd2 Benoni. White has managed to avoid burning a tempo on h3, and he will look to abuse the c4-square in the coming moves. Broadly speaking, Black has two ways of handling the position, and it all comes down to the b8-knight and whether Black wants to put it on a6 or d7. White must react somewhat differently in each case. }

12... Nd7

{ At first this position might look like nothing special for White since Black managed to break down his central space and doesn't seem to have any major weaknesses, and Black will likely win the fight for the b5-square. However, if White knows the right plan, he can count on a big advantage. }
17. Kh1

17... Bd7 18. Bd3 Qf6 19. Rf3
{ White overprotects the knight on e3 and gets the rook out of the way. His plan for the coming moves will be Qc2  @@StartBracket@@attacking f5 and forcing Black to pacify one of his pieces with either Ne7 or Rf8@@EndBracket@@, Bd2, and then Rag1! with g4 to follow. This last step is not too easy to figure out at the board alone and without it, Black has good counterplay, but with it, I think White will crash through on the kingside. }

{ White plays in largely the same way he would against the Ng6 line, but it is quite a bit harder to smash through with Rg1 and g4 if the knight sits on h6 than if it sits on g6. So, White needs a different plan. }
21... Kh8 22. Raf1
{ First White gets his rook off of the queenside, and now he is ready for Ncd1 next. }
22... Re7 23. Ncd1
{ Petrov does not mention this powerful move. White is ready for Bc3 and Rg3 next, challenging the g7 bishop. Black will have a tough position with a loosened kingside, but there is still some game to be played. In general, I think this represents his best chance to play against the Nd2 system, so it is unsurprising that he is not lost or anything like that, but White is obviously for choice. }

{ In my opinion, the Benko Gambit is a somewhat underrated opening.

I've certainly managed to mess it up from the White side time and again, and I have never lost playing it with Black. I think the most important thing for White to do is to find a setup that promises him a safe position where he won't have to make a ton of difficult decisions or contain a lot of counterplay, and I am willing to accept a smaller objective advantage to reach this goal. }

Any book written that long ago will be mostly outdated, which it largely is, but it says a lot about the quality of Kaufman's work that even a single line has stood the test of time for 8 whole years. White is ready with the standard plan of preparing Nb5 to shut down the b-file and then gradually maneuver the b1-bishop to the long diagonal, leaving Black with no compensation. }
12... Ra6
{ This is another coordination Black can consider, where he brings the queen to a8 to pressure the e4/d5 pawn chain with e6 and he clears the 8th rank to get the rook to b8. It makes quite a bit of sense, but White should be better if he knows what to do. }
13. Qe2 Qa8 14. Ra3
{ b3 is coming next and White is good to go. A good rule of thumb for the Benko Gambit is that if Black ever plays e6 after already playing d6, White should take it and force Black to take with the f-pawn to mess up his structure. This position is no exception. }

{ In my opinion, the Benko Gambit is a somewhat underrated opening. I think anyone with half a brain knows that White is objectively better, but of all the lines that Black can choose where he accepts a worse position for practical chances in an unbalanced game, I think the Benko is one of his best options. I've certainly managed to mess it up from the White side time and again, and I have never lost playing it with Black. I think the most important thing for White to do is to find a setup that promises him a safe position where he won't have to make a ton of difficult decisions or contain a lot of counterplay, and I am willing to accept a smaller objective advantage to reach this goal. }

Now, much like I want to do after Rxa7, White will promptly overprotect the c4 bishop and use it as a glorified pawn to shut down any hope of counterplay along the a6-f1 diagonal. }
10. Nf3 Ba6 11. Nd2
{ White has secured the bishop on c4, and he is always ready to take back with the knight and meet Qa6 with Qe2. Black will not take control of the key diagonal. Note that because the queen is on a7 instead of a5, Nxe4 is not a problematic move to deal with anymore. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 b5
{ In my opinion, the Benko Gambit is a somewhat underrated opening. I think anyone with half a brain knows that White is objectively better, but of all the lines that Black can choose where he accepts a worse position for practical chances in an unbalanced game, I think the Benko is one of his best options. I've certainly managed to mess it up from the White side time and again, and I have never lost playing it with Black. I think the most important thing for White to do is to find a setup that promises him a safe position where he won't have to make a ton of difficult decisions or contain a lot of counterplay, and I am willing to accept a smaller objective advantage to reach this goal. }

{ 8.Bc4  As mentioned in the course, I would prefer this move. But I mostly included the game to show Martinez's handling of the middlegame. }
8... Qa5 9. Nd2 Bxa6 10. Bxa6 Qxa6 11. a4 e6 12. Nb5
{ I like this decision. White forcefully pushes Black's queen off of the a6-f1 diagonal by threatening Nc7. }
12... Qb7
{ 12...Rc8  This is possible, but White can simply castle out of it. After  13.O-O  exd5  14.exd5  Black struggles to complete his development with the knight on b8 having no good squares, and if he tries to grab on d5, after  14...Nxd5  15.Nc4  He has a lot of problems to solve with a knight coming to d6 next. }
13. dxe6 fxe6
{ This is a serious mistake. In general, in most Benko lines, White wants to respond to e6 with dxe6, forcing fxe6 and a weakening of the pawn structure. Here, Black still had the option of taking back with the d-pawn since he had not yet advanced d6.   13...dxe6!  Nc6-d4 would give real counterplay. Black is worse, but the game goes on. }
14. Qe2 Na6
{ 14...Nc6  This feels much more natural to me, though after  15.O-O  Nd4  16.Nxd4  cxd4  17.e5  A position like this one highlights how much better Black's position would be if his d7-pawn were on f7 instead. He would not have to worry about supporting d4. }
15. O-O Qc6 16. e5 Nd5 17. Nc4
{ White's strategic triumph is complete. He has assumed control over the all-important f1-a6 diagonal, he has stopped any counterplay with his well placed knights, and he has preserved his extra pawn. }
